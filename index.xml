      <description>Então você está pensando em organizar um devopsdays na sua cidade, hein? Nessa hora surgem várias dúvidas, as quais iremos responder da melhor maneira possível neste momento.
devopsdays é um evento internacional, não é meio grande demais para a minha cidadezinha? Definitivamente não, quanto mais diversos forem os locais onde o evento ocorre, mais diversa a discussão em torno de DevOps será, e isso significa que o ponto de vista das pessoas da sua comunidade local ainda não foram colocados em pauta e é a cultura DevOps que está perdendo com isso.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is a report with data stats and lessons learned about DevOpsDays Sao Paulo 2018, held on 06 and 07 of June at Hotel Century Flat.
Goal Most events with DevOps subject in Brazil have more like Ops profile, others events that are trying to reach “DevOps public” add a track about that. But, often talks have subject around tools. We would like to discuss to invoke subjects beyond Infrastructure as Code and/or Continuous Delivery.</description>

      <description>DevOps es una propuesta nacida en el 2009 en Bélgica, como resultado de las innovaciones introducidas en la práctica por un pequeño grupo de experimentados desarrolladores y operadores de sistemas, que tenían resultados reconocidos por el gremio TIC en la resolución de problemas cotidianos; entusiastas de la colaboración y el intercambio.
El propósito de esta cultura es lograr mayor calidad y eficiencia en la construcción de productos y servicios informáticos y en la administración de sistemas que se encuentran de cara al usuario, sobre la base no sólo de la aplicación de buenas prácticas, procedimientos y costumbres asociadas a la operación de sistemas y su construcción, sino también de las que mejoran la comunicación y colaboración entre los recursos humanos que producen, certifican y administran los mismos.</description>

      <description>En las empresas modernas el desarrollo de Tecnologías de la Información (TI) debería ir aparejado con las operaciones TI; pero en las empresas tradicionales los desarrolladores y los especialistas de operaciones TI trabajan en departamentos diferentes con escasa comunicación entre ellos, provocando todo tipo de problemas que impactan los servicios que se proveen y perciben los clientes o usuarios finales.
Mitigar estos problemas entre los desarrolladores y especialistas de operaciones TI es el objetivo principal del movimiento DevOps.</description>

DevOpsDays Seattle 2017 was held at McCaw Hall on April 26th and 27th. Around 400 participants saw a mix of internationally known and local speakers talking about their challenges and successes.
After the end of the event, we sent around a survey. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.
Some things we think went well:
 The speakers all did a great job.</description>

      <description>Don Norman and Jakob Nielsen say “In order to achieve high-quality user experience in a company’s offerings there must be a seamless merging of the services of multiple disciplines, including engineering, marketing, graphical and industrial design, and interface design.”
What does continuous UX evaluation look like? How do we meet users expectations? What does it look like to merge UX into DevOps practices? I’ll answer these questions and discuss the similarity of Lean UX and devOps processes and how they can work together to bring better experiences to end users and team members.</description>

      <description>“It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming
Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage.
Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops,” cloud-based services and platforms (like Cloud Foundry) automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards.</description>

      <description>The great management thinker Russell Ackoff once said, “The righter you do the wrong thing the wronger you become.” Unfortunately, continuous delivery and devOps can be used to do the wrong thing righter (and much more rapidly). What can be done to ensure the right thing is being delivered?
Strategy deployment is a method for enabling better decision making by translating high level executive strategy into actionable and meaningful goals. Workers at all levels of the organization are able to use these goals to prioritize work items and identify high information value experiments aligned with the organization’s strategic direction.</description>

      <description>Do you wake up in a cold sweat when you think about what would happen if one of your devops people were to suddenly vanish, or win the lottery? Could you carry on? Can anyone on your team take vacations to cell-phone dead spots?
DevOps is such a dynamic and flexible part of an organization that it is the absolute hardest thing to get documented, and the place where it really makes a difference to burnout if you have managed the miracle.</description>

      <description>Many companies have long recognized the link between productivity and a fun work environment. “Play” is not just essential for kids; it can be an important source of relaxation and stimulation for adults as well. Adult play is a time to forget about work and commitments, and to be social in an unstructured, creative way. Play can add joy to life, relieve stress, supercharge learning, and connect you to others and the world around you.</description>

      <description>At Eventbrite, the operations team recently completed a multiyear project to move all our infrastructure from EC2 classic to VPC. We learned a number of lessons along the way and had to make changes to how we worked
 technically within our team within the broader organization  in order to pull it off.</description>

      <description>Infrastructure as code is a pattern that allows a team to sustainably scale services without requiring increased effort in the form of manual repetitive tasks, which are generally seen as error prone and not intellectually engaging. What some people do not consider is that infrastructure code is subject to the same technical debt accumulation as any other code, and hence benefits greatly from software development patterns such as continuous integration and test automation in order to ensure that functionality does not degrade over time, and that maintenance does not become prohibitively difficult.</description>

      <title>The Five Dirty Words of CI</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Blameless postmortems&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;learning from failure&amp;rdquo; are very en vogue in the technology industry right now. Both fall into that less-discussed category of &amp;ldquo;CI&amp;rdquo;: Continuous Improvement. But for as much as we all talk about them, in many organizations and teams, the outcome of continual organizational learning and improvement remains elusive. Why is this?
In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at five &amp;ldquo;dirty words&amp;rdquo;* that are often thrown around during postmortems, retrospectives, and other learning exercises that not only make it difficult for teams to discuss learning, but promote activities and behaviors that are actually counterproductive to continuous improvement.</description>

      <description>“A great flame follows a little spark.” -Alighieri Dante
Technology was not born in a vacuum. Incredible thinkers across disparate non-tech fields planted the seeds to create modern technology. Leaders in technology changed the world with enlightenment from boundless worldwide wisdom and creativity inspired by history’s greatest artists and lateral thinkers.
We will explore aphorisms, idioms, and quotes from a wide range of fields including philosophy, sociology, history, literature, art, and music, and how their meanings can make better techies and collaborators.</description>

      <description>We all know that DevOps is not (only) about deploying the latest WordPress anymore. There is a growing number of projects that have huge deployment scripts - think OpenStack or OpenShift. In this context it is extremely important to keep deployment code readable and maintainable.
This talk will not try to give you a best practice overview, but show you how Ansible as a whole could be improved. Ansible has a very rich set of features, its YAML files however are often a stumbling block and understanding a big YAML project is not a task for bystanders.</description>

      <description>Fast response to changing markets, flexible automation and cross organizational integration are the key features for the industrial landscape of the future.
I&amp;rsquo;ve first learned about DevOps about 2 years ago. With my background of industrial automation I felt somehow as a stranger while attending my first DevOps conference. After a while it dawned on me that DevOps can solve many problems in my working area.
This talk is about what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from DevOps.</description>

This data is the company&amp;rsquo;s most important asset, and we take great care to make sure everything is properly backed up. Yes, even the lolcats and puppy picture posts. Everything!
As you can imagine, backing up this behemoth of a dataset is quite a challenge.</description>

      <description>According to Gartner Inc. &amp;ldquo;By 2020, a corporate &amp;lsquo;no-cloud&amp;rsquo; policy will be as rare as a &amp;lsquo;no-internet&amp;rsquo; policy is today.&amp;rdquo;
While cloud adoption is increasing steadily by moving workloads away from dedicated, on-premise equipment to an IaaS or even PaaS model, the transformation goes on: FaaS, also known as &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo;, is the next step in cloud evolution.
Despite all the buzz it is important to understand the different cloud models and pick the one that best suits your current needs.</description>

      <description>The why: In DevOps we talk about a cultural change. We aim to tear down silos and create small cross-functional, autonomous and empowered teams. So why not only let management do the next big re-org thing, &amp;ldquo;the DevOps re-org&amp;rdquo;, and all is going to be fine, right!? No, because its about people. Interacting people. And for really changing a companies culture, the way people interact together, we need to establish, recreate and foster trust.</description>

      <description>We were looking for a better way to represent the experience of our clients and the reliability of our site. We found that the traditional uptime metrics did not work well for us, since they did not account for the satisfaction of our client base. Traditional uptime was also vaguely defined, with no consensus over which component should be broken in which way for which duration of time, in order to qualify as downtime.</description>

      <description>With the rise of DevOps, containers are at the brink of becoming a pervasive technology in Enterprise IT to accelerate application delivery for the business. When it comes to adopting containers in the enterprise, Security is the highest adoption barrier. Is your organization ready to address the security risks with containers in a DevOps environment?
In this presentation, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn about:
 An understanding of the underlying technologies for Containers and how they enable DevOps The security risks with deploying containers in the enterprise The dangers of untrusted content and importance of maintaining container images How to make your Container workflow more secure using Kubernetes without slowing down DevOps Automating vulnerability management, security management, and compliance checking for container images in a Kubernetes environment  Join, Chris Van Tuin, Chief Technologist, West at Red Hat, as he walks through an overview of the underlying Container technologies, the security risks with deploying containers, and how to address these security challenges in a DevOps environment with Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>Docker Docker Docker! is the driving call these days, but what&amp;rsquo;s it like to actually roll out containers in production with existing applications and infrastructure? How do you get buy-in from development teams? How does docker mix with existing legacy code and infrastructure? What’s the operational experience like for developers who are on-call?
In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how PagerDuty migrated a number of existing applications to containerized infrastructure in production, simplifying build and deploy along the way.</description>

      <description>Our brains take in a lot of information on a daily basis and have created shortcuts to automate simple tasks like walking, taking a drink, or sitting down. These tasks hit the fast parts of our brain that includes memory, reflex and emotion before making it to our logical, analytical, and problem-solving (slow) systems. This leads to unintended and sometimes counterproductive processing which impacts everything we do.
This is part of cognitive bias and can lead to incorrect diagnostics during a firefight or major outage - our experiences can lead us to a decision that is based more on emotion than fact.</description>

      <description>This ignite talk will share case study learnings on using free and open source tools to automate the development, testing, QA, and deployment of a complex US government web site.
Operations people want stability. Developers want change.
Using docker, gitlab, and other supporting tools, we achieve consistently stable deployments as developers continue to improve the product. Running automated tests on every merge request ensures that broken code is never pushed to production.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Mean Time To Repair</title>

      <description>Mean time to Repair (MTTR) has long been the defacto metric for those tapped with the responsibility of up-time. It’s the cornerstone measurement of how well teams respond to service disruptions and a key performance metric that nearly all in IT should aim to consistently improve. Swift recovery provides far more benefits than attempts to engineer failure from complex systems.
As important as MTTR has become, the mean time to repair is no more than an average of how long it took to manage individual incidents (from acknowledgement to resolve) over the course of time.</description>

SaaS first, PaaS second, IaaS third so goes the mantra&amp;hellip; That&amp;rsquo;s all fine and dandy but the thing they don&amp;rsquo;t tell you is how much you&amp;rsquo;ll depend on Governance, Vendor Management, Legal, InfoSec. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like it to really bog down your hyper-versatile Top Gun DevOps teams.
To be successfully, you&amp;rsquo;ll need them to work on a level and agile playing field.</description>

You spend the day trying to focus on that new tool you&amp;rsquo;re building for the developers, it&amp;rsquo;s going to make their lives so much easier, but you find that you&amp;rsquo;re firefighting all day. The day ends and you wonder &amp;ldquo;what did I even do today?&amp;rdquo;. In our roles as DevOps practitioners, we live an interrupt driven life, but how do we make progress on that new internal tool or investigate that new OSS project?</description>

      <description>When all preventative measures fail, sometimes Really Big Problems occur. Your crisis team needs to respond and act accordingly to resolve issues efficiently. Any highly functional team will need a leader. It&amp;rsquo;s not optional, especially in crisis. Decisions need to be made quickly and someone needs to coordinate efforts rather than getting knee-deep in technical issues.
This talk will explore exactly that role. When should you choose a leader, and when everyone is busy putting out the big fire, what should the leader actually be doing?</description>

      <description>Distributed Systems are a complex topic. There&amp;rsquo;s abundant research about it but sometimes it is hard for a beginner to know where to start. I would like to outline the main concepts of distributed systems, so the interested person can have a clear path on how to start their own research as well. In this talk I will review the different models: asynchronous vs. synchronous distributed systems; message passing vs shared memory communication; failure detectors and leader election problems; consensus and different kinds of replication.</description>

Nor while working as number 2 in a start up nor in a small team embodied in a multinational global player. With DevOps, new specialists joining the team. The diversity grows and that will it not make easier to develop such a culture.

      <description>Data breaches are on the rise and placing increased pressure on Enterprise IT to protect the business. With the rise of DevOps and as hackers takes advantage of known vulnerabilities on unpatched or misconfigured systems, Enterprise IT increasingly needs to automate vulnerability management, security management, and compliance checking. OpenSCAP is an opensource tool for automatically verifying the presence of patches, checking system security configuration settings, and examining systems for signs of compromise.</description>

      <description>Businesses want to ensure that their end users are happy so they can maximize productivity, loyalty, and profits. But poor performing applications cause serious business issues. In today’s DevOps organizations and agile environments, it is essential to ensure application performance management throughout the full application lifecycle from the End User to Infrastructure. To achieve this, modern application performance management faces a challenge:
 on one hand, it has to be extremely flexible and agile on the other hand has to provide all necessary information on all transactions end-to-end  in production as well as development and test environments so that people are talking the same language.</description>

      <description>Devopsdays is a worldwide series of technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them. Each event is run by volunteers from the local area.
Most devopsdays events feature a combination of curated talks (see open Calls for Proposals) and self organized open space content. Topics often include automation, testing, security, and organizational culture.
History The first devopsdays was held in Ghent, Belgium in 2009.</description>

      <description>The health of your culture is a product of the ideas, beliefs and behaviour of your human colleagues. The health of your platform includes the health of the humans that build and support it.
In this talk Hannah will discuss the very human aspects of DevOps and why we need to take a more Human approach to DevOps transformation. @HumanOps</description>

      <description>Over the last few years we’ve seen an explosion of complexity, in everything from polyglot storage to composable infrastructure, containerization and microservices, config management vs immutable infrastructure. Until recently there was a set of widely accepted best practices for running in the cloud. But now every element of your stack is a never-ending rabbit hole of possibilities and questions. What&amp;rsquo;s an engineer or architect or manager to do? Solid technical judgment is more important than ever.</description>

There are two types of sessions planned:
 Regular talk; these will be either full- (45 minute) or half-length (20 minutes) talks. Lightening talk; these are presented in during a lightening talk session. They are 5 minute slots.</description>

      <description>Tuesday, Apr 25, 2017 - Tuesday, Apr 25, 2017 devopsdays is coming to 大崎ブライトコアホール !
 Japan is famous for its engineering excellence, leadership in manufacturing, and high-quality craftsmanship. But as anyone who has worked in Japanese IT can attest, Japan’s software processes are lacking.
While most of the world has gone the way of agile and DevOps, Japan is only beginning this journey. The general entrenchment of System Integrators and rigid workplace cultures will make this especially challenging for Japanese organizations to adopt.</description>

      <description>The conference will take place Tuesday July 25 and Wednesday July 26, 2017 at the downtown Minneapolis Hilton.  In past years, we worked with the hotel to make space available for nursing mothers, and if that would be useful for you, please let us know. We&amp;rsquo;d also be happy to accommodate any other accessibility needs. You can reach out on devops MSP Slack or via email.  The recommended way to travel between the airport and downtown Minneapolis is via the light rail train to Nicollet Mall station.</description>

      <description>Title: How does the SRE team makes HH stable Description:
HeadHunter is a site, where job seekers find vacancies and employers find employees. In the daytime we receive 3K requests per second (without static content), that turn into 25K RPS to backends and 50K RPS to databases. Earlier our uptime could be lower than 99%. Now - it is 99.9% and better. In the presentation I will describe how do we constantly making the reliability of the site better and better.</description>

      <description>Тема: Как измерить поток? Описание:
Если верить Джин Киму - автору девопс-бестселлера &#34;Проект Феникс&#34; - усиление потока (flow) есть первый благородный путь методологии девопс. Концепт потока не так сложен для понимания - это количество конструктивных изменений, количество произведенной ценности движущейся сквозь трубопровод нашей компании. От творческой идеи в наших головах до её реализации в виде услуги или продукта доставленного клиенту. Да доставленного так, чтоб клиент остался не просто доволен, а восхищен нашей способностью делать вещи быстро и качественно.</description>

      <description>Title: Open Source != Free Software Описание:
В Open Source свобода – это средство для достижения общей цели, где все работают вместе и строят большую программную инфраструктуру. Но бывают ограничения. С Open Source нужно вести себя аккуратнее и подробно читать используемые лицензии. Во Free Software свобода – моральная ценность. Free Software говорит, что копилефтные и разрешительные лицензии это хорошо, но разрешительные лицензии дают вам юридическое право делать что-то неэтичное (минимальные запреты), чего вы никогда не должны делать.</description>

О том, как можно применять гибкие методологии в организации с 5000 программистами, 1500 приложениями и сотнями тысяч вагонов. О сложностях взаимодействия территориально разнесенных команд, и как эти сложности успешно преодолевать. О том, какой секрет позволяет вести рабочие совещания с участием 70-ти человек, разделенных 9-ю часовыми поясами и находящихся по всей России от Калининграда до Хабаровска, имеющих свое личное представление, как точно нужно работать.</description>

      <description>Title: Готовим тестовое окружение, или сколько тестовых стендов вам нужно Описание:
Казалось бы, что нужно для организации тестового окружения? Тестовая железка и копия боевого окружения — и тестовый сервер готов. Но как быть, когда проект сложный? А когда большой? А если нужно тестировать одновременно много версий? А если все это вместе? Организация тестирования большого развивающегося проекта проекта, где одновременно в разработке и тестировании находится около полусотни фич, — непростая задача. Ситуация обычно осложняется тем, что иногда есть желание потрогать еще не полностью готовый функционал.</description>

      <description>Title: Lower your TCO with custom solutions and NGS Description:
I will share with the audience why I prefer custom solutions to ready-made tools for many systems engineering tasks. Imagine all the time you will have to really work on your system while not upgrading a &#34;turnkey&#34; module to the next version, which might include &#34;breaking changes between minor versions.&#34; Imagine the peaceful feeling of looking at two screens of your own script instead of figuring out what went wrong somewhere between the 2000+ lines of the code written by someone else.</description>

      <description>Title: Antifragility applied to DevOps. And to your life Description:
This talk builds on the brilliant book written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. It was published in 2012 and not many people realise its full potential yet. Antifragile systems gain from disorder. It is the exact opposite of fragility. Every attack makes it stronger. And therefore it operates beyond resilience and robustness. The Chaos Monkey that was developed by Netflix to help manage its IT systems, is an excellent example and because of its success it already turned into a full blown Simian Army.</description>

      <description>Title: When program developing goes well or the best practices of secure code development. Description:
Stress-mode code development is a normal in modern software industry. The ever conflicting demand of quality, price and speed commands even successful IT-companies. There were a lot of words said about effective testing, deployment and what reaction should be on the different incidents but the quality-price-speed triangle is still alive and dominates the development. We will present our practical experience in secure software code development in Solar.</description>

Мы хотим поделиться нашим опытом к подходу к внедрению DevOps в Райффайзенбанке. История началась года назад. Год назад большинство, если не все, процессы в деливери и поддержке был ручными. Мы расскажем как мы подоши к организации внедрения, как строилась работа, какие области были в фокусе. Мы расскажем об ошибках и проблемах, которые мы испытали в процессе и о том, как эти ошибки были исправлены.</description>

      <description>Title: Building a PaaS with Docker, Consul and Python Description:
I&#39;m currently single-handedly building a Database-As-A-Service platform. And the problem of where and how to run database instances has been successfully solved in favor of Docker. But there still remain 2 problems: how to link containers on different hosts across the network and how to orchestrate a large pool of running instances. You may find lots of different IaaS offerings and schedulers like Mesos and Kubernetes on the market, but all of them have a steep learning curve.</description>

      <description>Title: DevOps для windows на базе ansible Описание:
В рамках доклада планирую раскрыть следующие тезисы: - на windows тоже есть не-legacy системы, их надо как-то доставлять - сложности в доставке многокомпонентной распределенной системы - можно все сделать “на коленке”, но поддерживать тоже вам - powershell - можно, но сложнее, чем заявляет маркетинг - что делать с разработчиками на C#, которые немного не в курсе всех этих “админских штучек” - NuGet + nexus - жизнь на гребне волны open source - что получилось в результате - как собираем, ставим и откатываем (если надо) - что можно сделать лучше    </description>

      <description>Title: DevNull. Как современные облачные платформы сводят объем Operations к минимуму Описание:
Управление инфраструктурой для работы современных веб-приложений требует изрядных затрат сил и времени. Практически неизбежны перерывы в работе системы. Современные облачные платформы позволяют практически забыть об администрировании и вместе с этим обеспечить высочайший уровень доступности и отказоустойчивости.    </description>

      <description>Title: Production testing through monitoring Description:
Identifying and fixing issues in new code before deploying it to production is important for every software development cycle. However, relying on traditional testing methods in the age of Internet-scale data driven problems may prove to be incomplete. Identifying and fixing the issues in production quickly is crucial, but it requires insight into usage patterns and trends across the whole architecture and application logic. In this talk I touch on inefficiencies of some of the most common testing methods, provide real world examples of discovering odd edge cases with monitoring and offer recommendations on top-down metric instrumentation to help DevOps organizations with identifying and acting on business-effecting problems.</description>

      <description>Title: BizOps and You Description:
There are plenty of materials on getting development and operations to work together. More conversations are happening around inclusion of other technology groups, such as DBAs and QA testers, into DevOps processes. That said, DevOps conversations has been largely devoid of talk about BizOps place at the table. The goal for any tech-centric group is not to build and/or architect the best technology, but rather to effectively support business.</description>

      <description>Title: What DevOps is NOT Description:
DevOps has been a hot topic in the industry for some time now. A lot of people been talking about it. Some have built business models around DevOps-related tools and themes. There are even conferences and trade shows dedicated to DevOps-oriented things. People have made career around talking about it. In light of all of that, I find it chuckle-worthy that very few people actually know what DevOps is.</description>

      <description>Title: Automate yourself out of running your applications with Apache Mesos Description:
At my day job, we went through a long roller coaster ride to find out how to efficiently deploy our microservices-based SaaS-platform on a daily basis having multiple deploys done by different developers to different cloud providers. As in our company, we are big proponents of the &#34;SRE book&#34; by Google I&#39;ll explain why in my opinion the future belongs to such technologies as Mesos and Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>Title: Внедрение DevOps в большой организации: в новый век за 1 год Описание:
Мы хотим поделиться нашим опытом к подходу к внедрению DevOps в Райффайзенбанке. История началась года назад. Год назад большинство, если не все, процессы в деливери и поддержке был ручными. Мы расскажем как мы подоши к организации внедрения, как строилась работа, какие области были в фокусе. Мы расскажем об ошибках и проблемах, которые мы испытали в процессе и о том, как эти ошибки были исправлены.</description>

      <description>Title: Слон в посудной лавке. Visual Studio Team Services в большой организации Description:
Мы используем TFS (Visual Studio Team Services on Premises) как основную систему для управления жизненным циклом разработки (ALM) и непрерывной поставки ПО (CD). В разработке мы используем различные технологии и экосистемы: Java, .Net, C#, PHP, Jenkins. Расскажу как ведет себя новый TFS в смешанной среде, как заставить его работать с non-MS экосистемами и технологиями, как обогнать время и не потерять ни одного дефекта.</description>

      <description>Title: Настройка окружения проекта в docker compose Description:
Развертывание окружения для запуска проекта на локальной машине всегда боль. Данный процесс замедляет вхождение новых людей в разработку проекта, порождает забавные и не очень проблемы с различием версий использующихся зависимостей. Передача знаний о том, что все таки требуется проекту, чтобы он работал довольно часто сводится к фразе &#34;спроси у %developername%&#34;, что весьма неэффективно. Vagrant решил часть проблем, но VM - это медленно и громоздко, а прогресс не стоит на месте.</description>

      <description>Title: How to stop being a DevOps engineer Description:
You think you&#39;re a DevOps engineer? I have some bad news for you - you actually don&#39;t exist. This is where you would say, &#34;But the recruiter told me...&#34; Really? Maybe you know PHP, C++, Python, Java, C#, XSLT? Perhaps even Excel? Wake up, Neo! I offer your the pill. Yes. Just one. There is no choice. There is no “DevOps Engineer”.</description>

      <description>Title: Расширение возможностей Ansible Описание:
Ansible – отличный инструмент для развертывания и управления инфраструктурой. В него изначально входят более 750 модулей для настройки различного ПО и сетевых устройств. Но по мере описания сложных ИТ-систем в Ansible рано или поздно наступает момент, когда стандартных средств не хватает. Именно тогда на помощь приходит механизм расширения возможностей. На данном мастер-классе я покажу основы создания расширений для Ansible. Мы рассмотрим модули и несколько типов плагинов, чем одно отличается от другого.</description>

      <description>Title: DevOps без булшита Описание:
Понятие DevOps незаметно перешло в разряд баззвордов, и за ним скрываются просто тонны разнообразных практик и представлений о том, что это, как это надо готовить и даже критерии &#34;есть девопс или нет&#34; будут отличаться у разных людей. Серьёзно, если опросить с десяток случайных ИТ-специалистов разной направленности, то их мнения конечно будут пересекаться, но каждый из них расскажет о проблеме со своей точки зрения, и порой они просто не будут совпадать, часто по ключевым вопросам.</description>

      <description>Тема: Учи.ру: PaaS, выделенные сервера, облако и снова PaaS Описание:
Компания Учи.ру стартовала с одного приложения на Heroku, и за три года выросла до миллиона пользователей, 100+ серверов и десятка продакшенов. Нам всегда нужны были стандартные для индустрии решения: мониторинг, ввод в эксплуатацию новых серверов и приложений, бэкапы, CI/CD и так далее. Но на фоне постоянно растущей логической сложности системы, с этими задачами было справляться очень не просто. Я расскажу какие инструменты и подходы мы пробовали, что сработало, а что нет и к какому стеку мы в конечном счете пришли.</description>

      <description>Title: Практическое применение практик DevOps при разработке большого проекта на примере API Мегафон Банк Description:
Перед нами стояла задача разработать крупный интеграционный проект - API Мегафон Банк. Проект имеет микросервисную архитектуру. Состоит из более чем из 30 микросервисов и 10 баз данных. Очевидно, что без средств автоматизации при разработке, интеграции и развертывании было не обойтись, соответственно был определен круг подзадач, о которых и пойдет речь, вот некоторые из них: • GitFlow подход или разработка на магистрали • Что хранить в репозитории • Интеграциия после каждого коммита и что в нее входит • Как организовать автоматическое развертывание более 30 приложений на 4 ветки и автотестирование • Авто документирование кода, проекта, баз данных • Как получать эффективную и быструю обратную связь • Взаимодействие участников команды Будут продемонстрированы как общие подходы, так и многие тонкие вопросы, с которыми нам пришлось столкнутся на практике.</description>

      <description>Title: Problems I faced while building just another Docker PaaS Description:
Docker made Linux Containers (LXC) technology available to everyone. However, using Docker for production deployment still involves traditional devops tasks like logs, monitoring, backups setup, periodic OS updates, ensuring availability and security. These tasks feel a bit different if we try to turn our own solution into a Docker PaaS. I&#39;ll tell the story of dockhero.io to demonstrate the difference between using Docker in production &#34;</description>

      <description>We have an exciting new venue for our 2017 conference, Noah&amp;rsquo;s Event Venue
Did you get a chance to attend our inaugural 2016 DevOps Days Event held here in beautiful Salt Lake City? If not, we understand, you maxed the location capacity of 250 attendees, which meant a LOT of you were left out (75 + waitlisted, a bunch of “please just let me in,” and only 5 no shows).</description>

      <description>Call for proposals is TBD   There are three ways to propose a session:  A proposal for a talk/panel during the conference part : these are 30 minute slots that will have the full attention of all attendees, as everybody will be in that one room. An Ignite talk that will be presented during theIgnite sessions. These are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) which are also presented to all attendees in one room Open Space session : even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during Open Space.</description>

DevOpsDays is a volunteer organized event for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. All of the talks are selected via an open CFP in order to present the highest quality conference possible. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.</description>

      <description>Marion Oliver McCaw Hall at Seattle Center is the region’s premier performance venue. 321 Mercer St, Seattle, WA 98109 McCaw Hall opened in June 2003 as a $127 million renovation of the Seattle Opera House, made possible by a partnership between the Hall’s two world-class resident performing arts tenants, Pacific Northwest Ballet and Seattle Opera, along with Seattle Center and the Seattle Center Foundation. This partnership secured $55 million in public funds and over $72 million in private philanthropic gifts to make the Hall a reality.</description>

      <description>Tuesday, Aug 1, 2017 - Wednesday, Aug 2, 2017 -- devopsdays is coming to Portland !
 Our event will be August 1st and 2nd.
BIG NEWS: We’re excited to be working with Config Mgmt Camp and Container Days! The two events follow DevOpsDays Portland for a third day of tech conference-y goodness in the same space.
The CFP process for each conference is separate, but we’re working with them so that folks who want to attend multiple events get a discount on tickets, and sponsors who want to sponsor multiple events get a discount.</description>

      <description>The third devopsdays Minneapolis, held July 20-21 2016 at the Hilton Minneapolis, was a balancing act between explosive growth and continuing what worked from 2014 and 2015. We’re delighted to let you know that the survey results seem to indicate that participants liked it! We had about 700 people attend the event. (For comparison, 2015 had about 350 and 2014 had about 250.) 133 people filled out the post-event survey.</description>

      <description>Introduction Below is a small summary of an open space that took place at Devopsdays Ghent (October, 2014). The goal of the open space was to find ways on how Devopsdays organizers and attendees can contribute to NGOs or other good causes.
Two prior Devopsdays events donated some of the profits to charity. Devopsdays NY 2014 donated to the drilling of a well in Cambodia. Devopsdays Belgium 2014 donated to Manbarnootaaf VZW.</description>

      <description>Most devopsdays events are a combination of curated talks and self organized conversations. The self organized content is known as &amp;ldquo;open spaces&amp;rdquo;. Open Spaces give attendees the opportunity to talk about anything they&amp;rsquo;d like. A person might suggest a topic they want to learn about, or one they feel like they can help others with. The topics range widely, from highly technical, to pure culture, to board games for networking.</description>

      <description>Introduction Congratulations! The fact that you have reached this page means you at least have an interest in spreading the devops love to the world. Back in 2009 when we organized the first event, we were probably as excited as you are now. But we were also bit scared and full of questions: how does this work? how do we get sponsors? what is the first thing we have to do?</description>

      <description>The explosion of devopsdays events in recent years is exciting for everyone in the community. Some of us have been in this space since before the first event in Ghent, while others are joining with the newest events coming online in 2015. In the last year we&amp;rsquo;ve added new global core organizers, seen the originator of devopsdays (Patrick Debois) move into an advisory role, and been thrilled by rapid expansion in the numbers and locations of events.</description>

      <description>ve&amp;#183;loc&amp;#183;i&amp;#183;ty rapidity of motion or operation; swiftness; speed. If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard me talk about Agile Infrastucture, or read my personal blog, you might have noticed that I frequently make references to Velocity. When we started planning DevOpsDays US, there was consensus from the beginning to backdraft Velocity.
I have a hard time saying &amp;lsquo;DevOps&amp;rsquo; was born at any one time or any one place, as doing so ignores a large body of individual and organizational work, knowledge and experience, but Velocity has to be considered seminal in the course of the formation and articulation of DevOps ideas and ideals.</description>

      <description>When we first started organizing DevOpsDays for the US, we all had slightly different visions about what we wanted to see and what we wanted to participate in.  On one hand, some of us really wanted to use Open Space Technology as the basis for some if not all of the program, while some of us really wanted to have presentations. We all wanted to have a &amp;lsquo;community&amp;rsquo; event, but we also wanted to leverage the expertise in that community.</description>

      <description>Designing distributed systems means considering failure scenarios—both likely and less so. Will the network let you down? (Almost assuredly.) Will some portion of your IaaS misbehave? (Have you met computers?) We build in graceful degradation for much of our automation but often neglect the (just-as-essential) human interactions.
The classic “hard problems” of cache invalidation and naming things revolve around our understanding of what’s correct and true and our agreements with one another on scope and relevance.</description>

      <description>Threat Modeling is a great method to identify potential security flaws, part of any secure design. But instead of investing time + budget in a top-heavy, big-model-up-front threat modeling methodology, we can use a lightweight value-driven approach to embed security right into the agile dev process!</description>

      <description>Tcpdump is awesome for debugging issues on the network layer. But sometime you want to do a bit more, like look into the application layers or do some aggregation. In this talk I’m going to show you how to use python together with the pcapy and dpkt modules to take tcpdump to the next level.</description>

      <description>In the 9 years I’ve been working with customers on continuous delivery systems I’ve seen some, ummm, great learning opportunities.
This talk will go over some of the more interesting things I’ve seen during this time and might even give you a light hearted hint at ways to avoid some of them.</description>

      <description>Been working with Jenkins for years until I saw the light in tools like Travis, CircleCI &amp;amp; Drone; an open source, container-based, fast, stable, and plugins are a breeze. So, when I see docker oriented companies, with no super custom processes use Jenkins, I can’t help but ask myself, WHY?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Failing fast,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;failing forward&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Learning from failure&amp;rdquo; are all the rage in the tech industry right now. The tech company &amp;ldquo;unicorns&amp;rdquo; seem to talk endlessly about how they reframe failure into success. And yet, many of us are still required to design and implement backup system capabilities, redundancies, and controls into our software and operations processes. And when those fail, we cringe at the conversation with management that will ensue.</description>

      <description>I used to say “but I’m not technical.” If I can learn it, write down steps, and lead others through a process it’s less work for the next person. Documentation should come from a place of empathy. Helping others was the motivation I needed to cross that chasm to a technical mindset.</description>

      <description>In 2011 the #monitoringsucs discussion started between system engineers. Now, after 6 years this area has changed a lot. Today most fast-pace organizations have modernized their approach to monitoring. We probe in high frequency, we made the monitoring systems distributed and use automation (configuration management) to control all parts of the monitoring stack. And our tools have changed a lot. They are now specialized for a given task, allow usage of exchangeable components, are easily interconnected and allow rapid development in a self-service model.</description>

      <description>serverless, sweet #serverless, why did they have to name you something so easily shamed? At RealSelf, we first tried adopting AWS Lambda as part of a customer facing feature in mid 2016. We knew both code and our cloud quite well, but our first #serverless attempt ended in failure because we didn’t yet understand appropriate use of this new approach to operating.
Fast forward to mid 2017, and my team decommissioned our last VirtualMachine Used for Automation.</description>

But if our goal is to align devs, ops, and other roles in the organization, then we need to ensure they are all monitoring critical business systems and do so in a way that takes advantage of the unique perspective that each role offers.
In this session, I’ll break down the expansive monitoring landscape into 5 categories that each provide a unique view of your systems.</description>

      <description>Around 4:00 PM on August 10, 1628 the warship Vasa set sail in Stockholm harbor on its maiden voyage as the newest ship in the Royal Swedish Navy. After sailing about 1300 meters, a light gust of wind caused the Vasa to heel over on its side. Water poured in through the gun portals and the ship sank with a loss of 53 lives.
The fundamental reason the Vasa sank is, of course, that the ship was unstable.</description>

      <description>Is it possible to enable the evolution of a monolith? After a hugely expensive (financially and culturally) failed attempt at a complete rewrite, Ticketmaster is attempting to do just that, bounce back and evolve the monolith that is Ticketmaster’s core ticketing platform. This multi-year effort requires striking a delicate balance between showing appropriate respect for the platform’s highly profitable 45 plus year history while not allowing past success to blind us to demands of a highly dynamic market of fans, artists, venues, and more.</description>

In the two decades since then, many things have changed but some constants remain. In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll identify common patterns that have emerged, share some lessons learned, and relate a few funny stories. The astute observer will notice that there is still one year left until it&amp;rsquo;s exactly twenty years, and accordingly I will attempt to predict the future based on trendlines and tea leaves.</description>

      <description>DevOps is hard. We have conferences all over the world giving insight into how to define DevOps, implement best practices, and continually improve those over time. I have found that building reliable and self-improving systems is only a part of puzzle - building reliable and self-improving teams is a big piece. I have been leading DevOps teams at a large Enterprise for a number of years. I have made a ton of mistakes and learned a few lessons on being a better leader and building successful DevOps teams.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is all the rage right now. Itʼs easy to get drowned in all the hype and mind-blowing features and not really hear about the battle scars that one might get during or after the move.
In this talk, Kingʼori shows that Kubernetes is not all roses by sharing why they had to move and what some of the biggest pain points were.</description>

      <description>The pace of development of Kubernetes is showing no signs of slowing. And when it comes to stateful workloads it may even be accelerating. We at MayaData should know as we contribute upstream to Kubernetes and related projects extensively.
In this hands on workshop we will review best practices for data and storage management on Kubernetes. Specifically we will go over Persistent Volumes (PVs) Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) and how k8s provisions them and how to manage them.</description>

      <description>A especificação por exemplo (SbE) é um exercício de aproximação do negócio e deve ser clara para todo o time. Quando o time se aproxima do negócio o engajamento é maior. A SbE é o ‘core’ em forma de documentação viva desta interação. Mas…o que é e como ela pode catalizar o trabalho do time?
Objetivo: Entender o que é SbE e como ela trabalha pelo time
A SbE tem como foco o que deverá ser feito, o comportamento da feature que será entregue.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s make a valuable interview by setting better expectations and creating better evaluation techniques.
Let&amp;rsquo;s make an honest interview by asking instead of assuming, and treating candidates like they&amp;rsquo;ll be treated on the team.
Let&amp;rsquo;s make a collective interview by encouraging dialog and testing a candidate&amp;rsquo;s to teach, learn, and work with teammates.
Let&amp;rsquo;s make a nice interview by ensuring the process is valuable to the candidate even if they&amp;rsquo;re not yet ready to join the team.</description>

      <description>When we talk about &amp;ldquo;schedulers&amp;rdquo;, many of us default to thinking of tools like Kubernetes, Mesos, Nomad, or Swarm. But the abstract challenge of scheduling&amp;ndash;determining what tasks to run when, with what resources&amp;ndash;has spanned the history of computing itself. We&amp;rsquo;ll begin our journey in the 1950s, and discuss the scheduling problems encountered in early processor design, mainframe resource sharing, and operating system development. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how high-performance numeric computing advancements shaped their own flavor of schedulers, and how the advent of the Internet and high-scale web applications has led to the tools we know and love today.</description>

      <description>As teams grow and systems become more complicated, what used to be a simple set of commands quickly become branching logic chains that require insight and expertise. Runbooks serve as a decent structure for communicating this to teams around the globe but may miss crucial information that only an expert would know. Finally, runbooks are only as good as the last time they were updated, and in regular use, they stay out of typical workflows and become forgotten until they’re needed most.</description>

      <description>DevOps includes developers operating, and operators developing, and everyone crafting code while taking responsibility for what happens when that code is in production.
Sounds great, in theory. What about in practice? What if you don’t know what your code is doing? Or what your users are doing to your code? Or what the code your code relies on is doing? Or what the code and machines that that code relies on are doing?</description>

      <description>I will provide a hands-on introduction to working with Cloud Foundry, focussing on DevOps aspects and explaining how a PaaS solution is an ideal platform for working in DevOps mode. I will first introduce a sample architecture consisting of three components: an API written in Node storing data in a MongoDB instance and sending events to a RabbitMq queue. A UI written in React, consuming the API and a mailer reading messages from RabbitMq and sending mails via an external mail provider (Mailgun).</description>

      <description>Last year I joined a company halfway through migrating from monolith to microservices. On the team responsible for the deployment of everything, as well as some services themselves, I have a unique view into how it&amp;rsquo;s going.
This talk will share my observations of what it&amp;rsquo;s like for an outsider to come to a microservice architecture, with some things that are going well and some things to avoid, so you can inform your own plans if you choose to go this route.</description>

Como fazer Assessment do time sobre práticas DevOps e como prepara-los? Quero ajudar responder as perguntas.
Com a mudança do Mercado de desenvolvimento de software e aplicativos utilizando métodos ágeis, ocorre junto com esta a mudança dos processos de controle de qualidade e testes de software, o foco dos testes nos modelos ágeis acaba sendo na automação de processos e testes, desde a origem da concepção do software até a entrega em produção.</description>

      <description>In this talk I will be sharing my Journey towards self healing infrastructure, which started with implementing self healing via SaltStack then Moving towards Rundeck and now finalised on StackStrom and How this self healing is helping us to resolve thousands of alerts without SRE intervention? This will include the pros-cons and high-lows we encountered in our journey while looking for a suitable workflow engine. How we added new things in existing technologies to make it fit for our environment and how user can learn from our mistakes and setup in your environment within hours.</description>

      <description>We asked a Fortune 500 software delivery leaders what holds them back. This talk is the analysis of their insights on what bottlenecks they encountered in their DevOps journey. We share discoveries on what helped them to overcome the bottlenecks and how they plan to deliver even faster. Using this we define some unifying themes on what areas provide the greatest return in investments of time and resources.

      <description>A Security State of Mind: Compliance and Vulnerability Audits for Containers
Data breaches are on the rise and placing increased pressure on Enterprise IT to protect the business. With the rise of DevOps and as hackers takes advantage of known vulnerabilities on unpatched or misconfigured systems, Enterprise IT increasingly needs to automate vulnerability management, security management, and compliance checking. OpenSCAP is an opensource tool for automatically verifying the presence of patches, checking system security configuration settings, and examining systems for signs of compromise.</description>

      <description>DevOps is not a position, title or an engineering degree. It is culture, empathy and collaboration.
This is the ammunition one needs to break down silos, poor communications, and ultimately ridding ourselves of these monolithic, stagnant and non-scalable ecosystem.
In Circle K Europe, a number of our new digital services takes the form of microservices and they are containerized and deployed in its natural cloud habitat. Coupled with bursty release cycles and highly competent in-sourced development/DevOps teams, these services can be integrated with traditional monolithic systems whilst providing a platform for exit and further innovation.</description>

      <description>Seems like all you hear about these days are Single Page Applications. Angular, React, Vue, Ember are transforming the way we think about the frontend. But what about securing these applications? This often tends to take a back seat to speed, animations and other cool features of these frameworks. Between cookies, tokens, keeping users authenticated, and handling resource access, securing these apps can be tricky - you may even feel like you need a second page (gasp!</description>

      <description>Tools exist in their environment. How, why and when you choose your tools has a profound impact on the culture of your organization, the same way that the sword creates the samurai and the horse creates the knight. Kubernetes is amazing. Therefore I will show a Kubernetes alternative, nomad. This is an open-soure tool from the Hashicorp stable that solves the problem of job scheduling for datacenters. I will give a short problem/solution focused presentation on how and why I use nomad for job schedling tasks and the environments within which I use it.</description>

      <description>Many organizations use data demonstrate value to customers. Like many organizations, ITHAKA runs its products on a micro-services architecture and also leverages usage data collected by our micro-services to demonstrate value. With hundreds of services that make up ITHAKA&amp;rsquo;s products, this presents some interesting technical challenges to make an observable, fault tolerant, scalable system to collect usage events and aggregate them into our data warehouse.
In this session I will share the components of our data pipeline built around Apache Kafka and Apache Spark, how it has scaled with our deployment of hundreds of micro-services, how we manage the quality of our event data, and how we monitor such a distributed set of systems.</description>

      <description>AIOps is one of the most promising fields where machine learning and in particular deep learning is starting to play an increasingly dominant role. Besides streamlining different tasks, machine learning algorithms are able to give additional insights into complex business processes, which most often cannot be maintained anymore by a human being without automation. One of the reasons is the number of interdependent system components which interact with each other in order to fulfil a certain task.</description>

      <description>Most companies today develop apps and deploy them on servers — whether on-premises or in the cloud. That involves deploying and managing all the underlying infrastructure for your app. What if you could just write the app code and not have to worry about the infrastructure and how it will scale? Amazon Web Services sparked a movement known as serverless or functions as a service (FaaS) with their launch of Lambda in 2014.</description>

      <description>The word dojo means “the place of the way.” Originally, dojos were learning halls attached to temples. At Verizon, we’ve created engineering dojos to accelerate our learnings around real challenges in our organization. Through a combination of coaching, doing, and evaluating, dojo participants transform knowledge into wisdom.
One of the main things we do as coaches is to establish shared understanding of the desired outcome by using a technique called story mapping.</description>

Segundo a OMS, estima-se que mais de 285 milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo vivem com algum tipo de deficiência visual. Eles por sua vez, apresentam uma qualidade de vida inferior quando comparados com quem vive sem deficiência.</description>

      <description>&#34;While technical mentoring can be very rewarding, it can also be really difficult. On my team, we pair new engineers and interns with a mentor and a coach. The mentor focuses on providing specific technical advice, while the coach provides career guidance, a path to integrating smoothly with the team as well as the company, and a safe space to express concerns or non technical questions. I’ll discuss the challenges I faced as a technical and career coach for my teammates, strategies for adopting coaching techniques in your day to day engineering work, and how a coaching mindset can cultivate trust and effective DevOps culture.</description>

      <description>From iterative improvement to the breaking down of silos, the core concepts of the &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; movement represent a shift in how the technology industry perceives the status quo. And, the community continues to thrive as DevOps practices increasingly infect other industries like banks, manufacturers, schools, and retail chains. But as the movement continues to grow, the full breadth of its benefits are limited by the scope of what we as practitioners apply its principles to.</description>

Even then changes were shipped periodically but the process was cumbersome. A stable delivery pipeline with tests, continuous integration and small atomic deployments with github flow gives us a leading-edge. The culture of logging and monitoring ingrained in our team helps us move fast.</description>

      <description>In this talk we will first review the core tenants of SRE based on the Google Definition, covering aspects such as SLIs/SLOs, Error Budgets, Capacity Planning, Availability, Monitoring etc. Post introduction we will focus on the different adoptions of SRE, making comparisons between Google and Netflix or Soundcloud, highlighting that its not a 1 size fits all. The main section of our talk will discuss the journey we took as a Business Unit in Cisco to go from Waterfall Based to DevOps &amp;amp; SRE, expanding on some of the hurdles, mistakes and wins along the way, hitting areas such as Dev/SRE breakdown and rotation, OnCall, Full Auto deploy, Proactive monitoring/observability etc.</description>

      <description>Recent kernel versions (4.5+, Ubuntu 16.4) allow a fundamentally new way of instrumenting operating systems. Instead of reading data from /proc, a large variety of kernel events can be traced and aggregated inside the kernel with eBPF. In the talk we will give a short overview of how to collect, store, and analyse high frequency events like IO-latencies and syscall counts, scheduling latencies, etc. with a monitoring system.</description>

      <description>After many years doing DevOps-y things before learning the term &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo;, I moved to a larger, more traditional IT organization, with a goal of helping modernize their outdated technologies and practices. The next several years brought many challenges &amp;ndash; technical, political, and interpersonal &amp;ndash; some of which were more easily overcome, and some of which, well, not so much.
I&amp;rsquo;ll tell the story from where we started (spoiler alert: it&amp;rsquo;s about as much juicy legacy as anyone can handle) to where we ended up, what we got right, and where I went wrong.</description>

      <description>While Agile development is largely considered the norm in development circles, there are still those to whom it is a mystery, mostly by the less technical people in the community. In this presentation I will offer a friendly and non-tech accessible way to explain Agile to your colleagues who may be struggling to understand why we do what we do, and I’ll do it all without talking about sprints or user stories, instead I’ll talk about Santa Claus and Lego Star Wars.</description>

      <description>All metrics should be actionable, if a metric isn’t actionable why bother capturing it. Organizations today are measuring hundreds or thousands of metrics, but what do these metrics tell us. Each team within an organization tracks different metrics and measures success differently. But how do all these metrics relate to the overall success of the business. Learn how to ensure your metric passes the “so what” test and contributes to the success of the business not just individual teams.</description>

      <title>Aligning DevOps and IT Support in the Enterprise, Through Intelligent Swarming</title>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-edinburgh/program/jon-hall/</guid>
      <description>As enterprises transform around software-led innovation, DevOps teams start to need to deal with customer support at scale, while IT Service Management needs to adapt to a new, fast-moving reality of increased developer autonomy and collaboration. One significant challenge is that ubiquitous multi-tiered structure of support team organisation, which, this presentation argues, is fundamentally incompatible with the DevOps philosophy. We propose its replacement with Swarming, a methodology that harnesses and enables the benefits of DevOps, while doing so on an Enterprise support scale.</description>

      <description>The first day of a new job is scary for everyone, even more so if your company or team doesn&amp;rsquo;t set you up for success. But how do we build an onboarding process that allows new engineers to do their best work, whether they&amp;rsquo;re switching tracks from school, another company, or just another team? I&amp;rsquo;ll go through ways I&amp;rsquo;ve seen onboarding devops folks go off the rails, and talk about how we can get things back on track.</description>

      <description>Operations is important. Operations has become decidedly not fun. How many people do you know who have “graduated” from operations and being on call? This perspective that we get to a point where we don’t have to do Operations anymore sets a bad precedence that keeps us from improving the core of the practice. Let’s change that!</description>

The trouble is, you don’t know what it is you should be building and all your stakeholders are shouting at the top of their lungs that their need is the number one priority. What do you? In this talk, I’ll discuss my experience working on exactly this problem, the techniques we took from the software delivery world and how they can be applied to an infrastructure build, as well as examining those that led to success and the things that didn’t work out so well.</description>

      <description>This talk builds on the brilliant book ‘Antifragile’, written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. It was published in 2012 and not many people realise its full potential yet. This talk explains that antifragility is actually the powerful engine under the hood of DevOps. And when you realise that, you will be able to locate the throttles in your organisation to maximise the speed and power of your DevOps transformation.
This talk answers two questions:</description>

      <description>Security has typically been done at the end of the development cycle if it’s done at all. This has all of the same side effects as testing quality just before shipping namely surfacing work and risk at the worst possible time. DevOps is forcing development teams to re-think their accountability. Not only are they responsible for functional quality but now they must also operationalize their software. I assert that they should also be accountable for security.</description>

      <description>Development teams were already struggling with adding security to their Agile development processes. But now, DevOps teams are pushing to release continuously, meaning integrating security will become even more of a challenge. With DevOps, teams will be expected to produce code faster and more often. Yet in order for DevOps to be successful, teams can’t just deliver functional code – they must deliver secure code. How can DevOps teams add security to DevOps without losing velocity?</description>

      <description>The journey of moving from traditional software development to doing DevOps can be a long one.
When you&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of it, it might seem as if there&amp;rsquo;s no real light at the end of the tunnel. You might feel like you&amp;rsquo;ll never reach 100%, per-Wikipedia-definition, DevOps.
But for those who say they&amp;rsquo;ve made the transition, at what point did they feel like they were &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rdquo;?
I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered some experiences from development teams who have made the move, to find out.</description>

      <description>Ecosia.org is the search engine that uses its ad revenue to plant trees. Search engine users have come to expect perfect reliability, which is challenging for a small engineering team of ten developers, with only two focusing on infrastructure. In order for the team to practice Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), including a balance between projects and toil, the developers designed a a self-service production platform based on Kubernetes which is simple to maintain, easy to extend, and provides a developer toolkit with sane defaults.</description>

      <description>AWS tasks are often multi-step processes. Often you have to issue a command, wait until the target object enters a particular state, and only then continue on by issuing yet another command, or click something else in the web UI. In this talk, I will demonstrate how to take control of AWS tasks using the AWS CLI and bash shell scripting. By combining the strategies discussed in this talk, you will no longer have to wait on AWS, nor will you have to employ multi-step, manual processes.</description>

      <description>The Jenkins Pipeline plugin is a game changer for Jenkins users. Based on a Domain Specific Language (DSL) in Groovy, the Pipeline plugin makes pipelines scriptable and it is an incredibly powerful way to develop complex, multi-step DevOps pipelines. These Pipelines are becoming the standard way to programmatically specify your CI flow, in this talk we will demo following things in detail:

      <description>SKA South Africa, a Business Unit of the National Research Foundation. We are building the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope (SKA), located in South Africa and eight other African countries, with part in Australia. The SKA will be the largest radio telescope ever built and will produce science that changes our understanding of the universe. Construction of MeerKAT&amp;rsquo;s 64 antennas completed earlier this year, and we have deployed a basic correlator for 64-antenna imaging using 40G Ethernet interconnected SKARAB processing engines.</description>

      <description>Manual testing of Embedded Systems is an expensive and time consuming process, always carrying risks due to the possibility of human error. By automating the testing process these problems can be effectively addressed. Whilst there are still small elements of testing which still need to be done manually, most can be achieved automatically. This, over the time, will reduce cost, time and effort involved, as well as increasing the reliability of the target system in question.</description>

      <description>Monitoring alerts from APM and other tools are being notoriously linked to alert-fatigue among the on-call operations team members. A significant fraction of these are false positives which end up wasting engineering / troubleshooting time. It is also not unusual to have different APM software to monitor different parts of the tech stack. Also, the potential for output customization in APM software is often limited.
The escalation process for alert resolution often goes through multiple people before it is finally resolved.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes scales and manages stateless applications quite easily. Stateful applications can require more work. Databases, caching systems, and file stores are harder to dynamically manage with data intact, and sometimes come with their own notion of clustering. Operators are Kubernetes agents that know how to deploy, scale, manage, backup, and even upgrade complex, stateful applications.
This tutorial will provide an update on the Operator pattern introduced by CoreOS, adopted by many community projects like Rook, Prometheus, and others, and supported by this spring’s release of the Operator Framework by Red Hat.</description>

      <description>The security industry works best with a waterfall approach to development and has not keep up with modern methodologies. This talk will look at tools and techniques to shift security testing left so software can be released early and often without increasing risk to the organisation.
Security is big business. Between security companies trying to sell us security-in-a-box and infosec professionals charging a fortune to tell us “we’re doing it wrong”, is it any wonder security is still an area that often deprioritised?</description>

      <description>In many organisations, development/operations teams are not in the same trenches with the security team. Talk is about how to build trust between different focus teams, how to put DevOps practices in-line with regulated and hardened environments.
This talk is about common sense and security automation. And how security should be a requirement in each production deployment.
There are differences, even in 2017, for Ops/Dev and Security regarding mindset on building, secure, resilient and yes agile systems.</description>

      <description>Em uma estratégia de release, independente da tecnologia utilizada, uma série de tarefas precisam ser mapeadas: como implantar a aplicação/voltar atrás em caso de falha, reconstruir estado após uma atualização, verificar se aplicação está apta a receber requisições, migrações de dados e etc
Mapear estas tarefas é apenas parte do problema, automatizá-las de forma que fiquem aderentes aos princípios de Infrastructure as Code (execução não assistida, declarativo, parametrizável, reusável, versionável) para transformar estes passos em uma rotina ao mesmo tempo executável e legível para seres humanos é o grande desafio.</description>

      <description>Automação é uma catalizadora e pilar fundamental da transformação digital. A capacidade de realizar entregas rápidas e eficientes não só agrega valor ao negócio das organizações como também desonera os times técnicos de tarefas mecânicas.
Entretanto, com grandes poderes vêm grandes responsabilidades. Organizações que buscam alto nível de automação estão sujeitas a problemas em uma escala maior se desprezarem questões como governança e controle. Automações executadas com parâmetros errados, ou por pessoas não autorizadas, podem gerar destruição na infraestrutura de TI.</description>

      <description>IGNITE TALK ABSTRACT In the past few years, large enterprises started adopting the microservices architecture, however, most ended up with a “distributed monolith” and could not realize the true benefits of microservices. In this talk, I will discuss the challenges of how we built microservices in the past and and what the future strategy should look like. The strategy of leveraging the “platform” (container orchestration + Service Mesh) to provide the outer-architecture capabilities in order to build business-focused polyglot services that are decoupled from the outer architecture.</description>

      <description>MIT Sloan Management Review published an article in 2007 titled Avoiding the Alignment Trap in IT. What the researchers discovered is that organizations don’t become high performing by starting initiatives focused on aligning business and technology. Rather, only by improving delivery performance first was it possible to achieve IT Enabled Growth.
This presentation shows why this is the case, what supporting evidence has accumulated in the last decade, and how to avoid the common traps that occur in digital transformations.</description>

Conceptually, it will become as important as Windows was in the 1980s, Java in the 1990s, and Linux in the 2000s. Now, Kubernetes is transforming how we deliver scale out, cloud native workloads, with an acute emphasis on portability across public clouds and private infrastructure. Kubernetes in the public cloud &amp;ndash; Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others &amp;ndash; is well understood by most cloud native developers.</description>

Unfortunately many shell scripts end up being neglected when considering CI/CD pipelines, leading to more manual work and bugs. This talk aims to correct that by introducing two tools: ShellCheck for linting and Bats for tests.
Shell scripts using bash are an essential part of any DevOps toolchain, either as full fledged programs or as &amp;ldquo;glue&amp;rdquo; to connect systems together.</description>

      <description>Everyone says they&amp;rsquo;re coding in Rust these days, but they&amp;rsquo;re not. Every system has some bash-flavoured blu-tack hiding in the corners. But how well do you know this arcane, abstruse, annoying programming language? In 5 minutes, I&amp;rsquo;ll educate, entertain, and inform you about a core part of the bash language - the simple conditional statement. This irreverent and funny talk, while yes, insulting bash quite a lot, will hopefully provide a whole bunch of &amp;ldquo;oh, that&amp;rsquo;s why it does that&amp;rdquo; moments too.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Pull Requests Welcome.&amp;rdquo; A phrase to indicate you&amp;rsquo;re open to community contribution, but it does nothing to help bring high-quality contribution quickly. Contributors have to ramp up in your code base, may not have a great test suite, etc. What steps can we take to enable that process?
This is the story of enabling easy, quality contributions for Elastic Beats. Our Beats project runs in unpredictable environments so we wanted our community to be able to build extensions for their needs as easily as possible.</description>

      <title>Battle Tested K8S: a practical how-to and the untold pitfalls of running Kubernetes in production</title>

      <description>While Kubernetes is becoming a de-facto standard and is quickly changing the way we consume our infrastructure and the way we deploy/develop our applications, it&amp;rsquo;s also introducing a number of challenges engineering teams will likely have to solve while migrating their services or managing their own clusters.
This talk is going to provide a practical first-hand view on the pitfalls and challenges we had to face running our own production clusters in the last two years.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes in general, and Istio in particular, have changed a lot the way we look at Ops-related constraints: monitoring, load-balancing, health checks, etc. Before those products became available, there were already available solutions to handle those constraints.
Among them is Hystrix, a Java library provided by Netflix. From the site: “Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.</description>

      <description>Getting started into the DevOps world is one of the most amazing and challenging experiences I had in my life. Considering I was coming from software development world, mostly working with Microsoft products for 12 years, the turnaround was simply dramatic. Suddenly I was in charge of managing automation builds for Linux-based products which I had almost zero experience with, having JIRA tickets to perform Ansible scripts to deploy to different environments and getting new products in different programing languages on a weekly basis was amazingly astonishing.</description>

      <description>Here’s the step that most people miss when documenting their product or process: they fail to empathize with their audience, and this leads them to either write the wrong doc or hide the right information somewhere their users will never find. Instead of saying “What do I know about this topic?” and writing that down in a blob, you should say “What does my customer/user/team want to know?” It’s a simple shift in perspective that will make your docs wildly more useful and easier to navigate.</description>

Los conceptos que usualmente se le asocian son: gran cantidades de datos, analítica de redes sociales, modernas herramientas para gestionar datos, datos en tiempo real, entre otros. Independientemente de como lo catalogamos, las empresas necesitan comprender y explorar cómo procesar y analizar de nuevas formas la variedad de información que tienen a su disposición.</description>

      <description>Black Friday is the scariest and most exciting day of the year at Shopify. We see nearly a year’s worth of growth in one day. In 2017 we had a very smooth Black Friday, but behind the scenes we had several large scale failures to our infrastructure. Although lots of things went wrong, there was nearly zero impact to our merchants. This talk will describe our approach to incident response and follow up, which focuses on reducing the impact of failures rather than on prevention.</description>

      <description>CD is great, but what if you are deploying too often? Deployments may be low cost/risk (hopefully!), but nothing is zero cost/risk. Blast Radius a tool (gradle plugin) that his team wrote that only deploys services as necessary in a CD pipeline. Keep your services in one large repository without deploying everything on every commit. The ideas presented could easily be implemented with other build tools.</description>

      <description>Coinbase has some fairly unusual security &amp;amp; infrastructure requirements. One of these requirements is that every server in our infrastructure is both ephemeral (&amp;lt; 30 days) and immutable. The deploy process for most applications is fairly straightforward: 12-factor apps are blue/green deployed behind a load balancer. Blockchain nodes, however, present a difficult problem: how do you blue/green deploy a server with 300GB on disk? In this session I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how we solved this problem in a Blockchain-agnostic fashion using a new project called Snapchain.</description>

      <description>Today, &amp;ldquo;infrastructure as code&amp;rdquo; has become normality for many of us. We provision our systems with the push of a button or via CI jobs, Jenkins probably being the most popular CI server to host these jobs. But how do we manage our Jenkins server? Quite frequently, it is manually installed. Security, credentials, plugins, jobs have to be configured. But what do we do if the server crashes? The more we move towards continuous delivery/deployment, the more important the permanent availability of the CI server is.</description>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-london/program/jon-topper/</guid>
      <description>People often think of boredom as a bad thing: I&amp;rsquo;ll argue that in systems design and operations, it can actually be a virtue:
Boredom is the motivation that leads us to automate the things we find ourselves doing frequently.
Software, frameworks or services that are &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; often seem that way because they&amp;rsquo;re predictable, reliable and trustworthy.
Bored is the ideal state for an on-call engineer.
I&amp;rsquo;ll make the case that we should ration our excitement, saving it for the things that differentiate us from the competition.</description>

      <description>The ideal DevOps project starts with everything stored in source control. As a coach I often find that too little thought is given to how a team will handle their source control branching strategy. Time and time again I have seen how this lone decision determines much of the complexity of both product and process. The ease of your journey to continuous delivery is largely dependent on this decision. I&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss this idea and talk about teams seeing success when they take time to make this decision and don&amp;rsquo;t just buy into master-only development or a model such as git flow.</description>

      <description>Let’s change the quality assurance mindset. Application testing plays a critical role in the application development process, what good is a product that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work? Though, how should we test? What should we test? and when should quality assurance play a role in the process?
In an ideal world users would use applications we build in specific predefined ways allowing us to build for the happiest of happy path scenarios. Though in reality, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t always happen.</description>

      <description>When DevOps methodologies are put into practice at other organizations, IT folks in regulated companies often shake their heads and say &amp;ldquo;it can&amp;rsquo;t be done here.&amp;rdquo; Walking into these departments is like walking into the past - security, mainframe-driven data flows, outsourced operations, and conservative business have led to a generation of IT departments frozen in the 1990&amp;rsquo;s.
What happens when you&amp;rsquo;re brought into an organization like that and asked to initiate change?</description>

      <description>Creating a fast flow in the value delivery stream and enabling feedback loops are at the core of DevOps ideas and principles. The talk discusses the issue and presents a solution for automating the flow and monitoring capability of information artefacts that represent the state of an ongoing project.
&#34;To build the right product it is critical for the developer to receive timely feedback from the end-user or the business or product owner.</description>

      <description>In an ideal software development world a centralised CI/CD model has a huge number of benefits but as your organisation scales so does the complexity of your pipeline. You may end up with multiple teams working on the same technology stack that have different tooling and deployment needs.
This talk will go through a practical example of a paradigm shift from a centralized to a decentralised CI/CD model focusing primarily on infrastructure and configuration management.</description>

      <description>Nowadays is common to have discussions on how a software can be developed and deployed in a shorter amount of time and with better quality. Unfortunately, it is also common to have at least three separate teams to accomplish that, a dev team, a QA team and an OPS team. This is not agile and it is common that the QA team is either testing or automating an artifact that it is already developed or even deployed to production.</description>

      <description>Championed by ideas of open source and transparency, coding for the “greater good” resonates with a wide variety of technologists, designers and developers. One of these issues is “mental health”: Having moved away from seemingly dusty therapist couches, mental health is now being “hacked” with modern technologies and sleek apps. However, designing and developing for a sensitive and distressing area is highly contextual and tricky to get “right”, potentially even dangerous.</description>

      <description>Serverless Architecture is the latest evolution of cloud native applications. It relies on FaaS* and other cloud services that enables user to write applications in different style than we have done it before. That gives better agility and cost to operate, however comes with its drawbacks.
Being one of the first Serverless Architecture adopters at large scale Antons have got an experience that he would like to share as well as implementation recipes with the community.</description>

      <description>Build engineering is fun, especially with the awesome choice of tools we have today! In this showcase I’m building a build pipeline with TeamCity. You are going to learn why build pipelines are useful (yes, not only for the sake of eye candy!), and how the CI server can optimise when properly configured.
In this talk I’m going to start with the simple scenarios and gradually introduce the complexity: scaling the project by adding constraints and requirements.</description>

      <description>Devops originally started as a way of enabling both developers and operations engineers to work better together, but over the years since its inception it has become much more than that. The principles of devops can be beneficial to everyone involved in creating software solutions, not just dev and ops teams. This talk will discuss practical ideas for how the pillars of effective devops can be used throughout entire organizations, the benefits of sharing operational effectiveness beyond the ops team, and how to use devops principles to develop and maintain a functional culture within your organizations.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s easy to complain about bad tools. It&amp;rsquo;s harder to write a great tool yourself. Once you step into the shoes of an internal tools developer, you realize that you&amp;rsquo;re balancing feature requests and constraints from a dozen different teams and an entire universe of complexity behind what should be a simple UI. In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how to gather information about your users&amp;rsquo; needs, how to balance between conflicting requirements, and ways you can fail to build a tool that your coworkers want to use.</description>

      <description>Immutable Infrastructure promises stability and repeatability for your environment and is considered by many to be the &amp;ldquo;enlightened stage&amp;rdquo; of an Infrastructure as Code practice. The benefits of immutability in infrastructure seem obvious: if you know a system has been created via automation that you trust, and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been changed since creation, then making changes quickly seems far less risky. In a cloud-based environment, Immutable Infrastructure starts with trusted, immutable machine images.</description>

      <description>Software Development is increasingly becoming a distributed process: Developers are now using tools that allow for distributed style development, and organizations are evolving to allow developers to work where they feel most productive. Many organizations, however, do not have a process or plan in place to set-up Developers for success. Employees can feel isolated from their team, suffer from impostor syndrome, and quickly lose motivation when these issues compound on themselves.</description>

During that time, I documented the entire process and have uncovered a rich set of ideas and questions that should help any team and company begin their own journey towards improved Site Reliability
Without prescribing a specific path towards SRE, I can share the path that we took at VictorOps.. including the questions we had, the conversations that came from them, the result of our efforts, and what remains ahead of us as we continuous improve our SRE efforts.</description>

      <description>In any DevOps conversation, there&amp;rsquo;s always talk of automating processes and shortening feedback loops, but what about &amp;ldquo;the third way&amp;rdquo;? If you aren&amp;rsquo;t thinking of how to build a learning culture, and sharing the knowledge across your organization, you are missing out on the crucial third piece to making DevOps a success. There is a lot more knowledge than you think among the developers within your company - you just have to find it.</description>

      <description>Midburn is the israeli extension of the Burning Man festival. Last year, 11,000 lucky people participated in the event. Because the event is in high demand, there are only two dates during the year one can purchase tickets. Twice a year ~25000 people are trying to access the same web service at exactly the same time. After four years with several failures and a lot of unhappy people unable to buy their tickets, we decided to redesign the whole architecture using only serverless components and to ensure no one will be left behind.</description>

      <description>InSpec is an open source testing framework for infrastructure with a human- and machine-readable language for specifying compliance, security, and policy requirements. Using a combination of command-line and remote-execution tools, InSpec can help you keep your infrastructure aligned with security and compliance guidelines on an ongoing basis, rather than waiting for and then remediating from arduous annual audits. InSpec’s flexibility makes it a key tool choice for incorporating security into a complete continuous delivery workflow, reducing the risk of new features and releases breaking established host-based security guidelines.</description>

      <description>Many are the roads that lead to CoDe (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) Paradise- some are more bumpy than others and some have pitfalls that you should look out for.
So what are these (potential) problems and how can you address or avoid them? Fortunately, others have already gone down the CoDe roads and made some experience.
This ignite presentation is based on interviews with a handful of Danish companies done as part of the start-up phase of a research project on Continuous Software Engineering.</description>

      <description>With the constant demand to build systems rapidly with more resiliency and less budget, compounded with on-call support duties and a seemingly endless stream of alerts, it’s no wonder that burnout has become a serious problem within the DevOps community.
In this session I’ll share ways that you can identify burnout and actions steps to prevent yourself from burning out. But we are also a DevOps community, which means we need to take care of each other.</description>

      <description>It’s the middle of the night and you’re awakened by a phone call. What could it be? You’re not on-call this week. You glance at the caller-ID and see that it’s a teammate who has been struggling at work. Maybe it’s a serious outage and they’re escalating it to you? You answer the call to discover your teammate is having a mental health crisis. What do you do?
Late one night in 2016, this happened to me.</description>

      <description>To win in business, you require the ability to sense market problems and respond with valuable technical solutions. Both disruptive innovation and sustainable growth are underpinned with the ability to deploy software nimbly, and with high confidence. It is important for the business team to understand the critical importance of DevOps, the mindset and to prepare for the speed that is acquired when teams adopt this culture. This talk introduces the topics of delivery orchestration, containerization and the DevOps mindset through the business lens to demystify the mindset and present the unique value proposition of organizations that successfully employ this mindset.</description>

      <description>Audiences interested in learning about the “Three Ways” and the application of the C.A.L.M.S principles to the way they work together can explore basic DevOps concepts in the business simulation “The Phoenix Project” created by GamingWorks BV. It is loosely based on the story of the eponymous novel by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr an George Spafford. Like the characters in the book, participants work together to meet a big, hairy and audacious goal: Successfully finish the troubled “Phoenix Project“ and turn around the bad financial situation of the fictional company “Parts Unlimited” within only 90 days.</description>

      <description>It seems like every day new terms are popping up, but trying to come up with an agreed upon definition for what they mean is a struggle. Even terms that have been around for a few years have multiple definitions. Do any two people define DevOps the same way?
Companies often come up with a new term to differentiate their offering from another. Spend less time wondering what a buzzword means and more time actually solving problems.</description>

      <description>As we venture into new fields, we sometimes forget to apply the lessons learned in the past. As machine learning (ML) becomes more accessible to developers without a data science degree, and ML models multiply, we begin to see a glaring deficiency.
Many of the ML frameworks support easily building and tweaking ML models, but do not offer source control. To make matters worse, ML models often require prolonged trial and error, and even small changes in parameters can produce large changes in model accuracy.</description>

      <description>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI\CD) concepts are increasingly adopted by many technology organizations and teams. CI\CD enables teams to establish processes that increase velocity, collaboration and quality of their codebase. CI\CD enables developer &amp;amp; operations teams to breakdown unnecessary silos and gain a deeper knowledge of their respective arenas.
In this workshop the participants will be introduced to the basic fundamentals of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. Participants will learn the core principles of CI\CD and have the opportunity to reinforce what theyâ€™ve learned in a hands on workshop featuring the CircleCI platform.</description>

      <description>Continuous Delivery helps to keep your software and Docker images updated and deploy new versions in production easily. Microservices are great reducing the attack vector and limiting the privileges or credentials access of each piece of your application. Containers provide an opportunity to implement better security, small, immutable, single process and purpose. In this session, we will discover real use case examples on how to make your CI/CD pipeline interact with Docker security tools.</description>

      <description>In this talk I will share the experiences of teams that are working on improving the adoption of Security Activities in Software Development Teams. The overall goal is to help teams to be self-managed on software security activities. We have been running a project for 3 years now on the understanding of how teams that adopt/use security activities in Agile/DevOps teams, which practices are adopted, challenges faced, among others. The research being conducted in the project aims on helping practitioners to improve their working practices by identifying possible gaps in the security approaches understand how the adoption of security activities in the software development can be improved in different organizations.</description>

      <description>DevOps is about improving the processes around all your workloads, so you can&amp;rsquo;t be blamed for wanting to consider using containers to speed up testing and deployment. Containers may be new to Windows workloads overall, but strides are being made with each release. What can you put in a Windows container and can you deploy those containers as easily as all the others? Take a quick tour of what works, what doesn&amp;rsquo;t and why.</description>

      <description>Clinical burnout has several causes. Chief among them are things like absence of fairness and a feeling of being ineffective in what we&amp;rsquo;re doing.
In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll cover some of those well accepted causes of burnout and talk about how a culture of shared ownership and responsibility will help avoid many of them.
I&amp;rsquo;ll also cover how adding new need to learn some fancy new tool and changing someone&amp;rsquo;s title to &amp;ldquo;DevOps Engineer&amp;rdquo; is more likely to make it worse.</description>

      <description>AI is such a buzzword, with its futuristic implementations and sophisticated machine learning algorithms (Hello, Deep learning!). We are using ML when we need external data to reach a working product because it would be impossible to solve it with the regular for/if/loops. What are the next steps? Moreover, what about Test, Release and Deployment? We will dive into AI implementations, its achievements &amp;amp; mistakes to discuss DevOps, Agile, ML &amp;amp; AI.</description>

      <description>Computers and the Internet-Of-Things generate data about our every move, passing thought or feeling. There is also a comprehensive set of data on our life’s context: our whereabouts, connections, physiological state, patterns of movement, and deeply ingrained subconscious behaviors.
While that information may not be immediately visible or easy to learn from, it is created, collected and saved. Over time, the pile of data grows. The processing technologies become more sophisticated and powerful.</description>

      <description>Agile and DevOps is not just about speed - it’s also about results for the business, and that implies delivery quality built into the process. A company only establishes itself in the market when they offer good levels of quality, scalability, capacity and availability. There are strategies for verifying quality in large projects, and one of the biggest trade-offs is choosing the minimum tests that need to be done by each commit versus the end-to-end tests that guarantee quality but this could take hours.</description>

      <description>Containers and Kubernetes are becoming the de-facto standard for software distribution, management, and operations. But deploying and managing Kubernetes requires significant in-house time and expertise.
For those considering embarking on a containerization and Kubernetes strategy, I will outline important considerations such as the benefits of a centralized Kubernetes operations layer based on open-source components giving IT teams more control and understanding. I’ll also dive into the unique challenges to consider in any Kubernetes deployment, such as the need for centralized monitoring, identity and access management, backup and disaster recovery, infrastructure management, security, and reliable cluster self-coordination and self-healing.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, rolling out changes for humans is not as easy as merging a pull request. How many times have you seen a new project management tool get rolled out, sometimes with much fanfare and polish, and just not get adopted? Have you ever seen your company announce a new business unit which led to a minor revolt? How scary is the word “reorganization”? If you have ideas on how your group’s processes could be better, want to launch a new tool that will work better as your company grows, or have to adjust the way you do things to meet new regulations, learning the basics of change management will help you to get your plans going, launch them effectively, and ensure they stick around.</description>

      <description>Change can be good. This talk will give an insight into transformation of a System engineer to a DevOps Consultant - thats me. In this session I will explain how to transform a traditional IT Operations mindset to a DevOps lifestyle without instigating fear of replacement. This will also explain why going DevOps is not a job risk for system engineers or IT.
Why would this talk be a good fit for the DevOpsDays audience?</description>

      <description>This is a deeply personal talk where I share my experiences as a woman in tech. Even though I’d worked for NASA and co-founded my own successful company, rampant sexism in IT and bad experiences speaking in public nearly destroyed my career. That continued to have ripples in my life until I found the DevOps community and the safe spaces it creates. I will examine common constructs about diversity and propose ideas to bring productive change to continue to build upon the solid foundation of inclusion we have created.</description>

      <description>I spent my first year as a DevOps engineer believing it was DevOps vs the business, a couple of months ago I came to the revelation that there was a better way to do things.
I recently have been embracing the team mentality as a member of a scrum team being the cog in the wheel that does the devOps/SysAdmin work for that team. There has already been a substantial change on the team.</description>

      <description>There is much discussion about systemic actions and attitudes that have been the basis for so much homogeneity and exclusiveness in large corporations. Patriarchy. Ageism. Cultural Biases.
But according to a recent​ ​McKinsey &amp;amp; Company study​, companies in the top quarter for racial diversity are 35% more likely to have financial returns higher than the national median in their industry, while gender diversity boosts performance by an additional 15%.
So what if we take the mathematical processes that built up those systemic attitudes as the norm, and break them down to their theoretical origins, in order to recalculate a sustainable procedure that would intentionally include diversity, equity and inclusion in its make-up?</description>

      <description>AI is such a buzzword, with its futuristic implementations and sophisticated machine learning algorithms (Hello, Deep learning!). We are using ML when we need external data to reach a working product because it would be impossible to solve it with the regular for/if/loops. What are the next steps? Moreover, what about Test, Release and Deployment?
We always value data and call our organizations “data-driven”, but now the impact is even bigger.</description>

      <description>The feedback loop is important to any modern tech setup, be it development, design, or devops. A fundamental key to that loop is logs. Logging is often the most straightforward way to get information from your systems, even if that information isn&amp;rsquo;t always clear. With ELK stack, things can become clearer.
Learn what makes up the ELK stack, how you can use it, and options for those reluctant to tackle logging on their own.</description>

      <description>Everyone has experienced the frustration of figuring out whether a colleague performed a task. Or worse yet, being the one performing that task and then having to re-type everything you did into a chat channel. Since most of us already use systems like Slack or Hipchat, the solution is simple: just do your work in chat so everyone can see.
In this workshop, Kevin Paulisse will explain and demonstrate how GitHub’s distributed teams use a chat bot, Hubot, as part of their workflow.</description>

      <description>Checklists are a common way to prepare for the best and worst scenarios. In this talk you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how checklists for your Ops can prevent disaster.
Whether it’s launching a rocket to the moon or deploying an application with Kubernetes, checklists are important. They help provide a reasonable expectation of things that should work in the specific situation you are in. In the case of technology, checklists can help ensure your application remains resilient in times of trouble.</description>

      <description>You can&amp;rsquo;t spell DevOps without package management. What constitutes a package is different in most folks minds when it comes to Windows. Come learn how to properly package software into packages with Chocolatey. Hundreds of organizations have turned to Chocolatey due to its extreme flexibility, common sense approaches, and building on well-known technologies like PowerShell. Even certain groups at Microsoft use Chocolatey!
When shifting from traditional methods of software deployment to packaging, there is a bit of a learning curve.</description>

      <description>Which cloud do we want: public, private, hybrid? How are we going to orchestrate containers? How many pizzas should our teams eat? Should everyone be on call, even front-end? Maybe we should only hire full-stack ninjas? Do we even want to dev some ops, or do we need site reliability instead? Technical decision-making is a sea of bad and worse choices waiting to happen; let&amp;rsquo;s talk about it.</description>

      <description>Apesar de essencial em estratégias de Entrega Contínua, frequentemente as verificações automáticas de qualidade de código são negligenciadas. As pressões e questões culturais criam resistência à antecipação de falhas. A gamificação é uma ferramenta poderosa para promover essas boas práticas.
Verificações automáticas de qualidade de código e testes automatizados são parte fundamental de qualquer estratégia de Entrega Contínua, antecipando falhas e agilizando processos de release, favorecendo confiabilidade nas entregas e processos simplificados.</description>

      <description>Are you having trouble getting applications delivered effectively and with velocity? Or maybe having production issues that cause frustration across all lines of business (development, operations, customer success, sales)? Are your customers getting increasingly frustrated with your product performance, availability and slow feature growth? You might wonder where to start and how to contain the chaos, collaborate across team boundaries, and put business needs first. And, you might be thinking that this “DevOps thing” is something that you need to sell to business executives who don’t want to think about technology details.</description>

Esse é o principal objetivo dessa palestra, sair da inércia e por a mão na massa.
Com essa palestra quero mostrar como usar DevOps em projetos pessoais usando github, jenkins, ansible e digitalocean.</description>

It can be the result of structured processes that drives engineers and managers to create the next breakthroughs. The key lies in understanding customer’s limitations better than anyone else (including the customers) and then finding breakthrough ideas to remove these limitations.

      <description>As an operator of a system, you will often find yourself with data in CSV or unstructured log files that contain the answer to questions you have. Which IP address is hitting my server the most? How many requests came during this time frame? What kind of queries are getting written to the slow log? You want the answers to those questions as fast as possible and either you don&amp;rsquo;t have log aggregation set up or inevitably there will some data that isn&amp;rsquo;t flowing into it yet.</description>

      <description>Trabalho na Concrete tem mais de um ano como DevOps participei de um projeto de time estruturante em uma instituição financeira onde o desafio era tornar e deixar a empresa ágil com a metodologia e se tornar digital e ser competitiva no mercado. Então o desafio era olhar para todo o processo de TI da empresa e avaliar em qual nível de maturidade a empresa estava, exemplo: Como era o processo de depilou de uma aplicação como era o processo de desenvolvimento de um novo produto, quais tecnologias eram usadas para resolver os problemas do dia a dia, como era a organização do time nas áreas.</description>

      <description>Moving IT infrastructure to AWS services creates a model of shared responsibility between the customer and AWS. This shared model can help relieve customer’s operational burden as AWS operates, manages and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the service operates.
How can you create a frictionless on-boarding environment when each of the product must implement specific requirements based on the 1) type of products is offered and 2) country in which their products are sold.</description>

      <description>反騷擾守則 DevOpsDays 致力於提供每個與會者一個自在的環境，不論性別、性傾向、殘疾、外貌、身材、種族或宗教。我們絕不容忍任何人騷擾與會者，無論任何形式。在會議場地使用帶有性意圖的言語及圖像都是不恰當的行為，包括在議程進行時。與會者若違反規定，大會將視情況予以處置或驅離會場並且不退還費用。
騷擾包含了涉及性別、性傾向、殘疾、外貌、身材、種族、宗教等語帶冒犯的評論；在公共場合展示帶有性意圖的圖像；蓄意恐嚇、跟蹤、尾隨、騷擾攝影與錄影人員；持續干擾議程或其他活動進行；不適當的肢體接觸；不恰當地展露性感。
參展單位、贊助商或廠商在會場或攤位也同樣必須遵守反騷擾守則，特別是參展單位不得使用性意圖的圖像、活動或是其他的方式。攤位工作人員(包含志工)不得使用性意圖的服裝/制服/扮裝，或其他方式來營造性意圖的環境。
如果與會者發生騷擾行為，大會可採取任何適合的行動，包含警告或將騷擾者驅離會場，並且不退還費用。
如果你被騷擾，或是注意到有其他人被騷擾，還是有任何覺得不妥的地方，請立即告知大會工作人員。
你可以透過工作人員識別證找到大會工作人員。工作人員將樂於協助與會者聯絡會場警衛或是法律相關單位，提供護送或其他協助，讓遭受騷擾的人可以在會議期間感到安全。我們重視你的參與。
我們期望與會者在大會場合以及相關社交活動中遵守行為守則。
行為守則 I. 我是 Devopsdays 的參與者，透過和其他會眾互相學習、分享，努力提昇自己和所處的產業。與會體驗是由我和其他會眾共同創造。我已經準備好為自己和其他與會者，貢獻我的活力、參與和感受來創造最好的體驗。
II. 我是為了與人互動而來到 Devopsdays。我明白具暗示性或貶抑的圖像、言語會冒犯人而讓人不自在。我同時也明白每個人都有自己的禁忌和敏感之處。在大會活動期間，當被告知某些事冒犯到別人或是讓人無法接受時，我將無條件接受。
III. 我絕對不會故意騷擾或冒犯其他與會者，無論性別、性傾向、殘疾、外貌、身材、種族或宗教，也不會坐視其他參與者被騷擾或冒犯。如果我知道有人感到不自在或不安全，我將會告知那些冒犯的人並通知大會。
IV. 如果我遭受騷擾或冒犯，我會告知身邊讓我有安全感的人以及大會。當我感到安全時，我會根據自己的判斷，告知那些冒犯者具體不當的行為，並希望對方是出於善意和無知的, 但我沒有義務這樣做。
V. 我明白每個人都是不同的，我會視他人行為的真誠程度採取寬恕的態度。不過首要之事是保護我與其他參與者的安全。我將毫不猶服或毫不保留地採舉這樣的行動，直到所有人對於安全都不再有疑慮為止。
VI. 我相信 Devopsdays 大會和與會者將會為所有人共同營造最好的體驗，如同我一樣。我相信 Devopsdays 能讓人更具力量，而我不會忘記我在這裡獲取力量來建立一個安全、成長的環境。如果我或其他與會者違反了這個活動的精神，我期望大會挺身保護與會者，將違反者驅離並連絡相關當局。

      <description>After spending several years automating application deployments with Puppet, I&amp;rsquo;ve transitioned to Kubernetes.
This presentation will compare and contrast configuration management with container scheduling. It will describe which problems are better solved by which tools, the advantages of containers for application deployments, and the lessons that containers can learn from the config management ecosytem.
It will conclude by exploring how the devops role needs to evolve in order to better support application deployments.</description>

      <description>Configuration Management is oooooold. So. Old. It&amp;rsquo;s been around for ages. But it plays a large part in IT modernization and digital transformation for organizations moving forward in a digital-first world. Provisioning, manipulating, and managing the components that run important services for your company is still a complex requirement, made only more complex by the addition of technologies like containers and serverless. This talk will cover some of the highlights from the evolution of configuration management and the role it continues to play for organizations transforming to embrace more DevOps methods.</description>

      <description>Today’s enterprises need to quickly act to meet customer demands to maintain their competitive edge. In response, applications have been rearchitected for speed, agility and innovation based on serverless compute or containers. Legacy networks are incompatible. Only application-specific connectivity-as-code can deliver networks at the speed of modern business. Will this cause the advance or demouse of DevNetOps.
App-Specific, connectivity-as-code enables businesses to instantly, securely and reliably connect applications and containers across any set of clouds, networks and devices.</description>

      <description>Nesta palestra, iremos analisar a construção de um dashboard para monitoramento de dispositivos Raspberry Pi. Aprenderemos como utilizar diferentes tecnologias e práticas de systems programming para deployment na &amp;ldquo;nuvem ™&amp;rdquo;, tornando nosso sistema acessível de qualquer lugar do mundo.
O dispositivo Raspberry Pi vem se tornando extremamente popular no mundo da IoT (&amp;ldquo;Internet of Things&amp;rdquo;, ou Internet das Coisas). Seu baixo custo (começando com US$10) o permite ser utilizado em vários cenários, principalmente automação residencial DIY (&amp;ldquo;do it yourself&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>A service mesh is necessary for organizations adopting microservices and dynamic cloud based infrastructure. Traditional host-based network security must be replaced with modern service-based security to accommodate the highly dynamic nature of modern runtime environments.
A service mesh provides a highly available, distributed solution to three critical problems:
 Discovery Services must be able to find each other. Configuration Services must accept runtime configuration from a central source. Segmenation: Service communication must be authorized and encrypted.</description>

      <title>Consumption is Fractal: Open Source Sustainability</title>

      <description>While open-source sustainability has been a common topic in the hallways tracks and dev channels of major projects for years, the Heartbleed vulnerability in 2014 catapulted the topic in to the spotlight. Since then we&amp;rsquo;ve seen many discussions about how open-source should be supported for the long term, but rarely much action beyond a few token donations and some long Twitter threads. In this talk we&amp;rsquo;ll look at an overview of what kinds of projects are out there, how sustainability works in real terms, and what techniques have worked or not worked over the years.</description>

      <description>Go hands-on with container visibility, troubleshooting and run-time security monitoring with the Sysdig open source tools (Sysdig, Sysdig Inspect, and Falco). Dive into Kubernetes internals using reverse engineering: why is that Kubernetes service valid but doesn&amp;rsquo;t work? How does service resolution work? How does Kubernetes instruct Docker Engine? Then apply this for security beyond just doing forensics on an attack attempt; learn how container security works under the hood.
Come learn all about runtime security &amp;amp; securing your containers with the open source tool Sysdig Falco.</description>

      <title>Containers, Virtual Machines, and Bare Metal - Oh My! Mixed Infrastructure Applications</title>

      <description>In a world of buzzwords and trends it is easy to believe that a type of infrastructure is now dead or that a new type is the future. Beyond those with clairvoyance, no one can say with certainty what the future of infrastructure will bring. What we can know is that in today&amp;rsquo;s reality many applications must run on mixed infrastructure - bare metal for static compute heavy loads, virtual machines for persistent data stores, and ephemeral short lived containers for stateless portions of the application.</description>

      <description>Whether it’s an unsecured Kubernetes configuration or the Meltdown/Spectre exploits, there’s always a way into your company’s seemingly secure containers. We’ll take a tour of the most surprising container exploits - and how to prevent issues with your own infrastructure.
One of the many reasons why we love containers is because they offer improved security, at least when configured properly. But how secure are containers that are set up in the most common configurations?</description>

      <description>In this talk we’ll move a discrete application and dependencies to an autonomous container to address management difficulties, and then examine problems and resolving these. Intended for container novices, the iterative problem and resolution approach will also benefit people who use containers.</description>

      <description>Continuous Delivery (CD) and regulatory compliance are two critically important ingredients in today’s connected organizations. CD enables you to move quickly and respond to change in an era where change is increasing at an exponential rate with no sign of slowing down. Regulatory compliance ensures that your organization takes the appropriate steps to follow applicable laws and appear to require adding burdensome processes and controls to your software development lifecycle. While they appear to be at odds with one another at first, they actually complement each other well.</description>

      <description>You know how software gets written, and your development methodologies are agile and empathic. How do you turn your software into something users can use, i.e. an application.
We discuss patterns that companies around the world have implemented to accelerate delivery, reduce risk, and save time and money.
Technology enabled patterns like: * Canary deployments; * Blue/green (or A/B) deployments; * Auto-upgrade, * Roll-forward, and; * Feature-flagging.
Technology is one piece of the puzzle.</description>

      <description>Since the Continuous Delivery book came out in 2010, it’s gone from being a controversial idea to a commonplace… until you consider that many people who say they are doing it aren’t really, and there are still plenty of places that consider it crazy talk. In this session Jez will present some of the highlights and lowlights of the past six years listening to people explain why continuous delivery won’t work, and what he learned in the process.</description>

      <description>Often testing can be viewed as a barrier to implementing Continuous Delivery and DevOps, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing my experiences of how we crowd sourced testing, learned more about our customers and removed the &amp;ldquo;testing bottleneck&amp;rdquo; in our delivery process.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about the crowdsourcing platform we used, how we adjusted our approach over time and how we were able to greatly improve the quality of our products.</description>

      <description>It is a well-accepted fact that organizational culture is the single most important critical success factor for driving DevOps transformation. However, with the emphasis on Continuous Delivery, is the DevOps definition of cultural transformation too limited to pre-production culture? Does the cultural value stream stop when the deployment button is pressed (or it presses itself)? While DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) do not share the same genesis, the dependencies for true end to end cultural transformation should be recognized and addressed.</description>

      <description>Can I teach you to do Continuous Delivery to the PowerShell Gallery for your PowerShell Modules in 5 minutes?
Why would this talk be a good fit for the DevOpsDays audience? Relational databases are further behind in the DevOps cycle than many other areas of the industry and this talk will add in a light hearted fashion some excellent points to think about.

      <description>In the last few years software companies have been forced to shrink their development cycles. At Datys we start adopting agile practices in Development. Continuous integration allowed the development team to remove delays due to integration problems. But Operations were left behind… Adopting containers and automating our deployment process using open source technologies, allowed us to release applications and services multiple times a day. In this presentation we share our experiences in this journey.</description>

      <description>Nearing the end of a DevOps transformation includes scaling automation and being efficient with time. Continuous Integration helps make that happen. We&amp;rsquo;ll use CI to deploy changes for the business at scale and show how to be confident in the process and code.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with some pre-made code and tests, explain that and then dive into situations on changes that have to happen for the business to deploy a required feature or change.</description>

      <description>This is the bittersweet story of Continuous Integration. CI is practice that we fell in love with, embraced and then never fully committed to. I’ll share with you the current state of CI, what we think we are doing when we say CI and what we are really doing in terms of CI. Then I’ll remind us all why we fell in love with CI in the first place and make some suggestions on how to get back to the good stuff.</description>

      <description>In order to achieve true continuous delivery, organizations must rethink the way they carry out quality assurance (QA) today. To continuously deliver software, organizations need to make sure tests, procedures and processes around quality are designed to fit inline with the flow of development, integration and deployment. While continuous testing is dependent upon strategic automation, it is not synonymous with automated testing. A continuous testing process encompasses other QA activities that impact overall product quality.</description>

      <description>Infrastructure-as-code and cloud platforms enable the definition, configuration and automated provisioning of infrastructure using code. Practices like version control, four-eyes principle, test automation, staging environments, deployment pipelines and investing in observability bring with them the confidence and speed to deliver infrastructure changes into production continuously.
In this lightning talk, I would like to highlight some approaches that have proven themselves in practice, and how infrastructure changes can be brought into production continuously by using test automation and pipelines.</description>

      <description>Contrary to what our popular fiction will tell you, a lack of sensation is not a superpower. People afflicted with congenital analgesia have move carefully through their world, frequently checking themselves for injuries they don&amp;rsquo;t feel from becoming infected and festering.
By default, most organizations are structured around job role. This inherently isolates all pain to very specific nodes of it&amp;rsquo;s org chart, often inoculating itself from feeling the feedback by ignoring it.</description>

      <description>Instead of talking “Free as in beer”, let’s talk “Craft as in beer.” Not too long ago the entire beer market was set to be two companies, Anheuser-Busch and Miller-Coors, but plucky little startup brewers have not only survived, but thrived. On a similar time-scale, most software was being developed in large development houses behind closed doors. Open Source was largely thought of as an unsustainable mistake. Now, small open source projects pop up every day and even successful companies are based entirely on Open Source Software.</description>

      <description>DevOps is the best, isn’t it? It feels great to be empowered to accomplish your goals without costly handoffs from, and consultations with, functional teams. But what happens to an organization as it scales its DevOps teams past one or two? Silos. And what do you get with silos? Waste. Unless, of course, you can get the silos talking to each other.
In this talk, we’ll delve into one possible solution to this problem: community-building.</description>

      <description>Banks are being disrupted by fast changing expectation from customers. Most of the banks are struggling due to: 1. Unprecedented demand on their IT (which is tuned towards reliability than speed) 2. Sophisticated technology landscape 3. Thought partnership between business &amp;amp; IT
In our journey towards introducing DevOps in the bank, we experimented and built various tools to bridge the gap between software development and system administration. During this journey we learnt and followed &amp;ldquo;lean principles&amp;rdquo; and the paradigm to treat &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure as Code&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Throughout our organizations there are different lenses of understanding. These lenses can cause the exact same picture to be viewed differently by viewers with a different lens. While these lenses provide incredible versatility and perspective to a company, they can become a liability in times where a shared understanding of a problem exists. Nowhere is this more prevalent than in the worlds of Dev and Ops. Together lets walk through the damage that these fragmented visions can cause, how we can repair them and the benefits to be reaped from a shared context.</description>

      <description>Throughout our organizations there are different lenses of understanding. These lenses can cause the exact same picture to be viewed differently by viewers with a different lens. While these lenses provide incredible versatility and perspective to a company, they can become a liability in times where a shared understanding of a problem exists. Nowhere is this more prevalent than in the worlds of Dev and Ops. Together lets walk through the damage that these fragmented visions can cause, how we can repair them and the benefits to be reaped from a shared context.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not continuous delivery if you can&amp;rsquo;t deploy right now.
In this hands on workshop we&amp;rsquo;ll configure an entire CD pipeline from first code commit to production deployment.
We&amp;rsquo;ll show how to&amp;hellip; - Promote trusted artifacts to ensure only the &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;right thing&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; is installed. - Use parallel pipelines to run every test every time even if they are defined by other groups. - Define several different types of pipelines such as security and performance - Configure roles and permissions to make sure people are empowered to do what they need to</description>

      <description>How Senior Leaders need to evolve to support a culture of continuous learning. I&amp;rsquo;ll share my personal journey and what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and observed as I&amp;rsquo;ve moved from being an engineer into leadership.
Some of the principles I believe are core to the Senior leadership evolution:
 Honor &amp;amp; Extract Reality Understand the work - Go &amp;amp; See (not Go &amp;amp; Tell) Provide strategic prioritization/focus/discipline Become a Teacher - Problem Solving &amp;amp; Improvement Kata Empower with accountability through context/purpose/mission Lead by Example (actions matching words) Human Error is NOT a root cause There is no single root cause Be a lifelong learner People are the organization’s #1 asset (R-E-S-P-E-C-T)  I will also touch on how lean and DevOps have inspired me as a leader and what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned as techniques and tactics (value stream mapping, A3 problem solving, WIP limits, retros, improvement kata) to apply within in the teams I support.</description>

      <description>Sick of getting paged at 2am and wondering “where did all my disk space go?” This has actually happened to me, and you can learn from my mistakes! New Docker users often start with a stock image in order to get up and running quickly, but that isn’t always the right answer. Creating efficient images is often overlooked, but important. Beyond saving resources, using minimal images also delivers important security benefits: include only what you need and not a whole runtime that might have security vulnerabilities.</description>

      <description>Online personas They connect you to what you use. Most of us have a few online personas to help protect our identities and compartmentalise our online activities.
You probably have a facebook, linkedin, maybe a twitter for keeping in touch. If you watch online media you likely have a youtube and comment occassionally, maybe even broadcast. If you game you likely have a Twitch or Azubu account to watch, comment on, or even stream.</description>

      <description>When we talk about psychological safety, and being able to share without fear of judgment, we don’t do a lot of talking about how to actually get there. Come explore what it takes to cultivate psychological safety for yourself and your team, and what gets in the way.
When we’re feeling stressed, threatened, or unsafe, our bodies help us do a lot of things better. We’re able to run faster, hit harder, yell louder.</description>

      <title>Cultural Legos: Self-Reinforcing Practices for Experimentation, Quality, and Delivery</title>

      <description>Ready to spend your Mondays doing something other than fixing what went wrong in the big release over the weekend? Not moving forward because of analysis paralysis? Tired of having work thrown over the wall? Three months into a 12-month project, and everyone expects there&amp;rsquo;s another 18 months to go? Your DevOps efforts may be off to a rocky start. No single change will solve all of these problems. Frequent delivery, automation, team ownership, experimentation, small iterations, and tolerance for failure all combine to form a set of cultural practices that reinforce each other, allowing for accelerated delivery of product value.</description>

      <title>Culture and Collaboration in DevOps</title>

      <description>While DevOps is a very appealing model on paper, many organizations don’t take into account changes to culture and collaboration required to be successful. The standard model depiction as a moebius strip masks the dangers of team siloing. While discrete organizational units are key in proper staffing and skill allocation, sharp divisions can easily cause DevOps efforts to experience partial or complete failure.
Successful DevOps requires a cultural shift where the boundaries between groups are softened.</description>

      <description>Breakfast is the meal where you prepare yourself for the day – for doing something great. In DevOps continuous improvement is an important goal for everyone involved. But what if the organizational culture is the way that improvement will be eaten before you can prepare for it?</description>

      <title>DashboardOps: Understanding how we diagnose incidents to create better dashboards</title>

      <description>The monitoring systems at our companies are one of the widest windows into how our services are behaving. They are where we go when things are going wrong. They are also how we communicate with colleagues and our future selves about how our systems are composed. These systems also contain archeological information about past events as we tweak them over time.
However, dashboards can sometimes be an afterthought. They can be left as a task for later, a low priority item that never gets finished.</description>

      <description>Devops is usually viewed from a traditional perspective of a collaboration of Dev, Ops, and QA, driven by the change in Culture, People, and Process. But how do you know where you stand and where to move? As in almost any field, data and metrics give you the gauges and instruments. In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the key measurements for the DevOps transformation process and provide you with 3 metrics you can start measuring tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Abstract Gathering telemetry data is key to operating reliable distributed systems at scale. Data Science is the art of extracting information from large amounts of data. In this workshop, we will cover a range of analysis methods, that are know to work well for IT operations data. You will deepen your understanding of the inner workings of these methods, and get to apply them with a modern data science environment based on the Python/Jupyter toolchain.</description>

      <description>Data-Shuffler is an tool we&amp;rsquo;ve developed at Ithaka to manage data processing across the organization. Data-Shuffler is allowing us to decentralize ownership of data-processing, ETL, and BI. Our organization is able to deliver tested, robust datasets much more rapidly than before, and we&amp;rsquo;re able to place the developers and analysts who understand their data best in a position to quickly access and transform data at production scale.</description>

      <description>Henry Ford once said, “The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.” So how can we learn the most from system failures? This session will move beyond “blameless” postmortems to show how we can use data to avoid &amp;amp; mitigate future failures.
I&amp;rsquo;ll cover best practices for gather systems-related data, people-related data &amp;amp; how to use the data to formulate actionable response plans &amp;amp; avoid repeating failures.</description>

      <description>structured data, dynamic data, big data, data driven….. we hear about data all the time. But what is “data” exactly? The term is frequently used, yet is rarely defined or thought of - and it turns out the answer to “what is data” is not simple at all. “Data” is a software concept which describes real world properties and information - and there must exist some process of creating “data” from those properties.</description>

      <description>Unlike CI/CD pipelines for applications, we can&amp;rsquo;t just delete the database and pop up a new one with each new version. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the production database, and get SQL Server content to developers in containers, and then flow schema and lookup data back into production with migration tools. You can bring the reliability and automation of CI/CD pipelines to Database DevOps with containers.</description>

      <description>Does your application or service use a database? When that application changes because of new business requirements, you may need to make changes to the database schema. These database migrations could lead to downtime and can be an obstacle to implementing continuous delivery/deployment.
How can we deal with database migrations when we don’t want our end-users to experience downtime, and want to keep releasing?
In this talk we’ll discuss non-destructive changes, rollbacks, large data sets, useful tools and a few strategies to migrate our data safely, with minimum disruption to production.</description>

      <description>Can you describe a situation that caused to realize you were privileged?
I have asked many people that question now, and what I have learned is that privilege is an Unconscious Incompetence. Being privileged is a non-event. When we become conscious of it we realize that our privileged experience is not applicable to less privileged people. What happens to them does not happen to us. Only when we become Consciously Incompetent do we realize the need to listen.</description>

      <description>With the trend towards increased usage of containerization, has your companies security practices kept pace? Many popular vulnerability scanners only examine the host OS, making it easier for CVE’s to go unnoticed. In this talk we explore how to identify and protect against vulnerable containers.
While containerization technologies such as Docker have many well-understood benefits, there are some non-obvious caveats that can impact the security of the overall platform. When vulnerabilities like Heartbleed are announced, DevOps teams often need to race to patch an array of impacted systems.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how to set-up a working continuous delivery pipeline for applications on Windows and open source tools only? Lets see how tools like Jenkins, Artifactory, PowerShell, Ansible, NSSS and Installer Generators could be used to do that. 
Continuous Delivery Pipeline creation for Linux is boring because it is so simple. All tools and approaches are well-known. However, if you are in Windows-land and do not want to pay for licensing cost of enterprise tools, achieving pipeline automation for Windows might be tricky.</description>

      <description>Having short, reproducible build steps are a must have for any continuous delivery pipeline - declarative dependency management with pom files, NPM, bower, yarn, composer etc. has been the standard for many years in most web centered scenarios. The idea to always compile all dependencies from scratch and check the binaries into version control are commonly perceived as a DevOps anti-pattern. However, in the embedded C and C++ world, declarative dependency management is still relatively new and one big roadblock to fast, reproducible and secure releases.</description>

      <description>One of the critical factors for development velocity is software correctness. Our ability to develop and ship new features fast is bounded by our ability to validate several aspects of the change: * Does the feature meet the requirements? * How does the feature affect existing code, and how can it affect the production environment? With continues codebase growth and new features being added, naturally our productivity decreases, and our need to improve the guarantees for quality and correctness increase.</description>

      <description>With the proliferation of container and cloud technologies, Kubernetes is currently becoming the de facto standard for cloud container orchestration. And although, Kubernetes itself does a fantastic job of running and scaling the container workloads it has been entrusted with, it does not take care of its own infrastructure. The X project was started last year to overcome this problem. This presentation will overview the challenges that the X team faced during the engineering process, and will elaborate on the most crucial decisions and solutions.</description>

      <description>Deployment pipeline for databases: What’s stopping you to treat database development in the same way that applications are developed? Where databases are different? Why is so scary to make database changes? This talk is about how to build a deployment pipeline able to answer these challenges bringing down the gap between DB and APP.

      <description>DALAS, the Direct Axis Loan Application System is a monolith 15 years in the making. Under heavy fire for a few years now it is undergoing continuous amputation, and a micro-service ecosystem is in construction around it. In 2017 that meant 16 dev teams, 21 environments, 125 deployables&amp;hellip; And configuration sprawl, database control by theft, plus watching planks warp while you and your team get your dev environment back from the dead,again, over a week, or 2.</description>

      <description>One of the toughest challenges in DevOps or Digitial Transformations is sharing the vision and helping stakeholders to feel progress.
Story mapping is a planning technique that can help show the full vision of the project being worked on. It helps all involved keep their eye on the end goals, while breaking up work into deliverable &amp;ldquo;slices&amp;rdquo;. Each &amp;ldquo;slice&amp;rdquo; helps show the end to end story, keeping the feeling of progress while adding capability.</description>

      <description>Are you tired of having DevOps initiatives blow up as if implemented by Wile E. Coyote? Stop prioritizing technology over process! Business problems will not be magically solved by simply selecting and purchasing new tooling. Effective processes are the foundation for real change and enterprise-wide adoption of DevOps culture. Specific processes vary by organization but the underlying patterns remain consistent. We will demonstrate the patterns that are used to build successful processes that will help you meet your business needs.</description>

      <description>Deploying applications in containers and connecting them together is a challenge because it forces developers to design for orchestration. The container ecosystem has largely converged on abstracting orchestration away from the developer and making the infrastructure more intelligent. If instead we push the responsibility for understand startup, service discovery, scaling, and recovery from failure into the application, we can build architectures that empower application development teams to understand how the software they write works in production.</description>

      <description>The tech industry aligns with DevOps being a set of practices and culture that an organization uses to deliver operational excellence. DevOps should not be a team, tools, or something you hire a consultant for. In development or operations practices anti-patterns are behaviors that crop up which hinder the best efforts of an organization. Learn to how to identify these DevOps Culture Anti-patterns (like tribal knowledge, silos, etc.), and then attack them in specific ways to resolve these issues.</description>

      <description>A tecnologia de Blockchain traz consigo uma nova forma de pensar certos itens como: infraestrutura, segurança, distribuição de dados e distribuição de código. Afinal, teremos algum problema em gerenciar essa nova infraestrutura? Se a rede é de fato distribuída geograficamente entre organizações, como ficarão meus processos de publicação? Características como imutabilidade dos dados e dos chamados smart contracts são fatores que nos fazem pensar em mais rigor sobre o quê e quando devemos publicar algo em uma rede blockchain.</description>

      <description>Integrating DevOps and Open Source tooling inside an Insurance Company as Manulife is, obviously, a challenge. Actually this challenge is not only technological, links with legacy apps, but also a cultural shift to a new security and risk era. In our journey to DevOps, people were surprised by how we have been close to security and risk teams. Most of people try to avoid them and they expected from us the same.</description>

      <description>What is DevOps? The first time I heard that term was as the name of a conference &amp;ldquo;DevOpsDays&amp;rdquo;, in 2015. Intuitively, the first thing I did was to google it up. A lot of definitions appeared for that term: &amp;ldquo;DevOps = Development &amp;amp; Operations working together&amp;rdquo;. Wikipedia says it &amp;ldquo;is a software engineering practice that aims at unifying software development and software operation&amp;rdquo;. But it turns out it goes a lot beyond that.</description>

      <description>As in a good Greek Tragedy, scaling devops to big teams has 3 stages and usually end badly. In this play (it’s more than a talk!) we’ll present you with Pentagon Inc, and their way to scaling devops from a team of 3 engineers to a team of 100 (spoiler – it’s painful!) In this talk we’ll take you to a scaling journey, from 3 developers to a 100. We’ll talk about the challenges each milestone in this growth brings, both technological and methodological, and how to solve those challenges using the right mix of people, the right selection of tools and the correctly crafted process.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer: laziness, impatience, and hubris.&amp;rdquo; – Larry Wall.
DevOps engineers, if anything, are the epitome of the three great virtues of programmers. Since the advent of DevOps in 2009, engineers created a plethora of tools and systems to automate every aspect of the software development and production lifecycle.
This presentation will dive into the answer of: what happens when a DevOps engineer uses their tradecraft in their home-life?</description>

      <description>Back in at the 2001 OOPSLA Conference, the term Software Archeology was first coined. It gave a set of tools and processes for understanding a poorly documented and poorly maintained software architecture. It didn’t just work for the undocumented codebases, but ones that are incredibly large and complex, even if good documentation exists. The idea was to follow the true archeology with investigative work to understand the mindsets of the people who did the original implementations.</description>

      <description>Optimizing the flow, amplifying the feedback loops and establishing a continual learning and experimentation environment while having several distributed teams working together is not an easy job. On one hand, establishing effective collaboration model between such teams requires special handling. Especially when considering the different barriers including the different locations, different languages and cultures. On the other hand, security regulations are usually more complicated when working on several locations. Security regulations are not an option.</description>

      <description>Predictable, repeatable, and automatable processes are highly valued in DevOps. This often narrows our vision and prioritizes the rules and processes over the ultimate business goals. in the world of whisky, the exact opposite qualities have led to some of the most prized spirits.
Whisky producers use a loose framework to provide structure and guidance, but also to provide freedom for experimentation while maintaining safety. This not only allows for special releases, but contributes learnings back to the overall production and guards against losses.</description>

      <description>The first phase of a major BCBST software delivery transformation, the first steps toward enabling true DevSecOps and CI/CD, is on target for completion by the end of 2018. Other teams had attempted this transformation before, but those attempts ultimately failed for various reasons. In early 2016, I was asked to step out of my role as Portal Architect / Portal Team Lead, learn how to “Do the DevOps,” and to “Build a team to pull that project out of the ditch.</description>

      <description>Along with the rise of Data Science as the “Most Glamorous Job Of The 21st Century” came the realization that roughly 80% of a data scientist’s time was being spent collecting, cleaning, and storing the information they needed to do their job. The emerging role of the Data Engineer was created to offload that work onto a separate team and reduce duplication of effort and inefficient use of time. This separation between the management and reliability of an organization’s data and the exploration and interpretation of that information has led to the same tensions that exist between developers and technical operations which we have been working to ease for the past decade.</description>

      <description>UX is driving you crazy, a black throwing off timelines and killing ideas. UX doesn’t seem Lean or Agile. Can’t anybody make wireframes? Can’t we circumvent or exclude these people? DevOps is truly about so much more than how developers connect with IT, how infrastructure is managed, and how frameworks can be improved. It’s about recognizing how many teams are truly involved in the software development process and finding better ways to make sure everybody is at the table.</description>

      <description>This talk will bring us back to basics and explain the core build building blocks of DevOps. With so many tools in the market it sometimes becomes over whelming for any one who is headed for a digital transformation. I will explain what is the essence of DevOps and that it is much more than just some tools and platforms. Its beyond tools and techs. This talk will also help beginners to understand that just learning some tools does not make the DevOps engineers , its about adopting the DevOps mindset.</description>

If you are a parent, thinking of becoming a parent or have parents learn how DevOps principles such as collaboration, communication and retrospectives can be applied to your relationships. This talk will frame some of the challenges of parenting through a DevOps lens.</description>

      <description>During an after hours outage of a Backing Service, a pet project of mapping all the details exposed by the API of our PaaS, CloudFoundry, into Neo4J, a popular Graph Database, proved invaluable. Using the insight provided by the GraphDB, we were easily able to visualize which apps were directly dependent on the Backing Service, subsequent downstream impacts, and alert the impacted owners of the apps.
Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to exploit the rich information exposed by today&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure to build a representation of our applications and backing services in a graph database which has led to:</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT In many DevOps talks, you see a speaker from a renowned tech company stand up and describe a perfect utopia of an environment. You look at the perfect environment and dedicated hordes of senior engineers they describe, and you despair of ever getting to that point. Your environment looks nothing like that.
Surprise– their environment doesn’t really look like that either! In this talk, a speaker from an unnamed tech unicorn describes their amazing environment– and then what they just said gets translated from “thought leader” into plain English for you by an official translator.</description>

      <description>SysAdmins are obsolete, we need more DevOps engineers! Or do we?
In this talk, the author will give several use cases from his personal experience helping organizations to implement DevOps initiatives and automation of software delivery and testing.
  Why technology X is not what you need right now Why ignoring skills that are already present in the team may be a huge risk Why everything-as-code is an effective approach Why not investing in team member education may be very destructive Why not having time is a bad excuse for not automating Why process improvement effects may not be observable immediately Why cost of automation sometimes is higher than the time invested in writing the scripts  </description>

      <description>DevOps teams bring together specialists from disciplines with different views on what is most important which forms the basis for groupthink. All closely-knit teams are susceptible to groupthink, a cultural attitude that implicitly rewards members whose striving for unanimity override their motivation to appraise alternative courses of action. DevOps team members from different specialties may often defer to the expert in a particular realm to solve individual problems.
This presentation examines groupthink within devops teams.</description>

This might form the basis for preventing groupthink; however, all closely-knit teams are susceptible to groupthink, a cultural attitude that implicitly rewards members whose striving for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action. For example, DevOps team members from different functional specialties may often defer to the expert in a particular realm to solve individual problems.</description>

      <description>It is no coincidence that the rise of Open Source has happened in parallel with the rise of DevOps. Both are a recognition of the Power Of The Developer, and their ability to not only implement technology, but also drive it. See how the basic tenets of Open Source map perfectly into DevOps, and at the core of both is a focus on the community and the individual.</description>

      <description>We like to claim DevOps is a culture - but culture is subjective, and objective companies tend not to pursue subjective disciplines. A good starting point to being objective about DevOps can be borrowed from the Definition of Done (DoD) of the Agile Scrum methodology. The DoD outlines code logistics and the relevant stakeholders at each point in a code&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle from local machine to end-user machine, ensuring a continuous way to provide various types of feedback to developers from the spectrum of stakeholders from quality engineers to delivery managers to product owners and finally the end-user</description>

      <description>DevOps is making organizations more efficient by breaking down barriers between software development and IT operations teams, but this new way of working also creates potential for new security risks and vulnerabilities.
To complicate things, DevOps is still misunderstood by many and information security isn’t always considered upfront. Furthermore, the ROI for ‘data bandits’ is ever increasing as people are becoming increasingly dependent on information technology at scale.
So how do we conserve efficiencies gained by doing DevOps while securing process and technology, and supporting a security conscious culture?</description>

Every organization that wants to scale their Infrastructure up will highly relate to the problems and solutions outlined in these examples.</description>

      <description>Agile and DevOps are software engineering methodologies that is largely used for software development not so much for COTS integration. This Presentation describes an innovative approach to DevOps used to build a large scale enterprise level messaging solution for the Department of Veteran Affairs and the lessons learned in the process. In essence, an ESB is an architectural pattern that provides for loose coupled integration. It is unique and encompassing in its ability to incorporate any organizations’ legacy systems, point-to-point messaging systems, as well as newer commercial off the-shelf (COTS)-based solutions.</description>

      <description>As a software developer working alone or in a small team, how do you best work towards the goal of CI/CD? How do you best live devops culture, and move yourself/team towards that end? You dream of a day when you can merge a PR, and your code automagically ends up in production. Where your system scales itself depending on load, all while you sleep, blissfully unaware. How&amp;hellip;? How can you get to such a wonderful and mystical place?</description>

      <title>DevOps in Action: How Nedbank went from quarterly to weekly releases in no time!</title>

      <description>A couple of months ago Nedbank started a new initiative called nWoW (new Ways of Working). Taking inspiration from the Spotify model we created a number of squads (product teams) responsible for landing new features on the Nedbank Money App platform. Both the GT DevOps toolchain and DFL DevOps teams joined forces to create an enterprise grade CI/CD pipeline by injecting DevOps engineers into the squads and automating the deployment pipeline.</description>

      <description>One of the key challenges of politics - as well as DevOps in general - is harnessing automation without losing the critical human touch which moves hearts and changes minds. Although this talk will mention specific technologies (including Hashicorp’s Vagrant), it is not intended as a prescription for those technologies. Rather, the emphasis is on the application of technology to solve real world problems. Learn how to find the line where too much automation (yes, there is such a thing) is counterproductive and you need to pull back to maintain a personal connection with voters, customers, employees, and more.</description>

      <description>Working technology for a political campaign involves the shortest timelines, tightest deadlines, and highest stakes you will likely ever encounter in a technology career. Come hear a tale of two political campaigns - a state measure campaign and a presidential campaign - and the application of both DevOps technologies and culture to move fast, pivot quickly, and hopefully win. One of the key challenges of politics - as well as DevOps in general - is harnessing automation without losing the critical human touch which moves hearts and changes minds.</description>

      <description>It is clear that Serverless is redefining DevOps. But, Serverless is not a silver bullet nor NoOps. Serverless removes some of the complexity but it brings whole different kind of challenges. While challenges are changing, DevOps is not going anywhere anytime soon!
The goal of this lightning talk is to make people realize that abstracting some of the complexity does not mean #NoOps. Starting with what Serverless is and is not, I will explain in which steps we need DevOps to the ultimate goal of running successful serverless applications on production.</description>

      <description>Most material available these days cover DevOps from a very web centric perspective. The pains and problems however are equally real in the embedded space. Software development has similar challenges across different industries but companies in the embedded space aren’t aware of or able to leverage existing tools and processes that they may believe aren’t relevant to their industry.
This is our journey towards embracing DevOps and transforming our development process within an embedded space.</description>

      <description>As DevOps becomes increasingly established in enterprises, and its outputs become widely adopted, DevOps practitioners increasingly find themselves absorbed into traditional, large scale IT support structures. Often this means becoming “tier 3” in a multi-layered support structure. The shortcomings of this structure make it the antithesis of DevOps: the siloed nature of tiered support creates work-in-progress queues. Cross-functional collaboration is limited, communication is disjointed, and knowledge sharing is difficult. In this presentation we will discuss Swarming: an alternative methodology now emerging in forward-looking enterprises, which sets out to dismantle the tiered approach, replacing it with a dynamic, lean, and cross-functional methodology which is a much better fit for DevOps.</description>

      <description>Over the past 500 years, there have been 16 cases of a rising power threatening to displace a ruling power. 75% of those cases resulted in war. Although your organizational transformation probably won’t lead to war, it could be contentious. History can help prevent conflict when driving change. This talk will analyze human tendencies, historical data, and provide real-world examples of how to prevent conflict during your DevOps journey.
DevOps needs to focus on more than Dev and Ops to be truly transformative for an organization.</description>

      <description>DevOps practices increase flexibility and precision by using automation for managing infrastructure and deploying software. As with any technology, there is a learning curve associated with it. It can be used to save time and improve quality, or abused and become an overly complex maintenance burden. Learn how to embrace DevOps as a culture and optimize your practices by recognizing anti-patterns and common pitfalls that others have figured out the hard way.</description>

      <description>A (hopefully) humorous look at the current state of DevOps and the affects of the rise of Kubernetes and Site Reliability Engineering on DevOps, how the culture is changing (again!), the tools are changing, and how we deploy and operate applications are changing. At the same time Serverless has exploded onto the scene and the thought* leaders are once again throwing terms like NoOps around.
The future however is bright and the Savvy Operator / DevOps practitioner will thrive and everything will turn out fine, and I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you why, and offer you hugs if you are struggling with change.</description>

      <description>Are you really &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo;? You have spent years going through an amazing transformation. You claim that you are now officially &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo;. But, what now? Your customers don&amp;rsquo;t really care if you are a DevOps shop/factory; they care about how your products –built from that shop/factory– add value to their lives. Common sense stuff, right? Well, unfortunately, no. You&amp;rsquo;d be surprised as to how many people still quite don&amp;rsquo;t get what the true spirit of DevOps is.</description>

      <description>Quando consumimos conteúdo sobre a cultura DevOps, na maioria das vezes, nos deparamos com a importância de utilizar ferramentas como Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, Puppet para conseguir entregar valor mais rápido. No entanto, pouco é falado sobre como incorporar essas práticas a cultura organizacional.
Para entregar essa velocidade é necessário pagar um custo que muitos não querem, não conseguem ou se quer sabem que deveriam pagar. Podemos chamar esse custo de &amp;ldquo;débito técnico&amp;rdquo;, pra facilitar.</description>

      <description>В ходе доклада я расскажу про то, чем отличается разработка blockchain платформы от обычной разработки или highload, поведаю о том, как мы тестируем ноду блокчейна и эмулируем работу распределенной системы - почему используем docker и зачем нам не нужен kubernetes. Расскажу про NoOps и почему хорошо, когда наши ноды падают и выключаются. Также я затрону тему разработки децентрализованных приложений (Dapps), расскажу чем их разработка примечательна и разберу возможности применения DevOps практик при разработке Dapps.</description>

      <description>This talk is intended for DevOps practitioners who would like to find new and creative ways to tackle their IT challenges. We’ll do this by comparing DevOps and cave diving, and looking at how you can apply strategies learned in one to the other. Cave diving is often considered one of the most dangerous sports in the world, yet some people still do it safely and enjoyably. DevOps pushes technology by making changes quickly, frequently, and often to large scale - isn’t that risky too?</description>

      <description>Окей, мы потратим один час вашего времени, чтобы показать как (по нашему скромному мнению) быстро и красиво решаются ваши ежедневные задачи в Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform на Microsoft Azure.
Что будет?
 Механизм source2image в OpenShift. Вы (и ваши коллеги по DevOps команде) просто берете линк на гит и даете его Openshift, дальше он сделает все сам: сам соберет и сам развернет приложение, покажет метрику, логи, отмасшабирует на заданных нодах до заданных величин.</description>

      <description>Virou buzzword, virou moda e marketing. Muitas empresas e times estão usando DevOps como rótulo para atrair profissionais, mas a maioria não faz idéia do que é, para que serve e como fazer. Que tal reservar um tempinho para ouvir falar de DevOps no mundo real, quais problemas ajuda a resolver, dicas de como implementar, ouvir histórias de lugares que trabalhei que deu errado e outros que deram certo. São 8 anos de histórias tristes e também finais felizes com DevOps, ajudando a construir sistemas e equipes.</description>

      <description>History shows us that we may not understand the significance of events until much later. Throughout my life, I learned the principles of DevOps; I just didn&amp;rsquo;t know it yet. I will reflect on how oil changes, sausage making, and carpentry gave me a solid foundation for DevOps.</description>

      <description>We often talk about knocking down the silos and spreading DevOps culture at DevOpsDays, but it’s typically within the context of experienced engineers and developers. Unfortunately, the role of mentorship in DevOps and spreading DevOps culture to students and recent grads is often overlooked.
In many companies, interns are simply viewed as cheap or free labor with no regard for the intern’s education. In other organizations, interns are regarded as a time drain on staff engineers who must dedicate extra hours for training at the loss of productivity.</description>

      <description>Software development is pressed for faster and faster release cycles with acceptable quality, budget and security. As movements like CI, CD and DevOps aim to cut down on release cycles, it&amp;rsquo;s security&amp;rsquo;s job to help control the risk. The risk landscape is complex as modern development practices increasingly consume more and more third party code. Traditional methods do not cut it anymore - it&amp;rsquo;s time for DevSecOps. This session gives an overview of how companies have implemented DevSecOps practices in their own delivery pipelines and how this can help increase developer awareness of risks affecting them.</description>

      <description>Desenvolver software de forma segura implica na adoção de medidas, processos ou técnicas que buscam por vulnerabilidades publicamente já conhecidas ou possíveis brechas de segurança nas aplicações, para que elas sejam evitadas de ir para produção ou corrigidas o mais cedo possível.
Entretanto, tradicionalmente as verificações de segurança são conduzidas como uma etapa posterior ao ciclo de desenvolvimento de software. Frequentemente até mesmo após a aplicação já estar em ambiente de produção.</description>

      <description>A metodologia DevOps não envolve apenas as equipes de desenvolvimento e de operações. Se você quiser aproveitar ao máximo a agilidade e a capacidade de resposta proporcionadas pela abordagem DevOps, também será necessário que a equipe de segurança da TI desempenhe um papel integrado em todo o ciclo de vida das aplicações da sua empresa.
Por quê? Antigamente, a segurança era delegada a uma equipe específica que atuava isoladamente no estágio final do desenvolvimento.</description>

      <description>For too long audits and security reviews have been seen as resistant or even blocking the frequent release of software. Auditors require access to static systems and environments, which would seem to make continuous delivery impossible. Too frequently audits are a fire drill sampling of the current state and temporary fixes are put in place to appease the compliance audit without being integrated into future releases.
What if auditing, compliance, and security could be fully integrated into continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines?</description>

      <description>DevSecOps is all the rage, but what does it really mean in todays world&amp;hellip;
What real-world problems are solved through DevSecOps?
How do we do Security/Compliance and Governance in a DevOps methodology. How do we deliver compliance in a scalable way? How do we avoid, detect and respond to security vulnerabilities while still maintaining maximum Velocity? How do we organize teamsour teams?
This talk will provide detailed information as to what is happening in DevSecOps in large and medium enterprises, and how we have solved some of these issues through innovative strategies around process, culture and of course Tools.</description>

      <description>DevOps purists may chafe at the DevSecOps term given that security and other important practices are supposed to already be an integral part of routine DevOps workflows. But the reality is that security often gets more lip service than thoughtful and systematic integration. This despite a threat environment, distributed development teams, and rapid iterative releases requiring security approaches that are continuous, adaptive, and heavily automated. Red Hat’s expertise with open source software and practices offers direct lessons for DevSecOps.</description>

      <title>DevSecOps: Security as a minimum viable product</title>

      <description>First open source won, then DevOps won. Now, there’s talk of DevSecOps — which by its very name suggests DevOps isn’t secure. Like DevOps, security isn’t a destination, it’s a journey. Rather than aiming for perfect security, what if we think of security as a minimum viable product?</description>

      <description>My team is finishing a 15 month project aimed to convert over 500 Enterprise applications to a standard development methodology and CI/CD pipeline. This included a company-wide re-org, defining new Scrum processes and attending bootcamps, and undergoing a complete tooling overhaul.
After roughly 12 months of the project was completed and 300 applications had been migrated, we realized only 8 applications were deploying to Production with the new tooling. This realization shocked our whole team – we had taken all of these applications from long weekends of manual deployments and tech bridges to automated builds and deploys with push-button functionality - why weren’t more people using it?</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is a powerful, operational platform for containerized applications. However, the developer workflow on Kubernetes – how you code, deploy, update, and monitor your services – is much less mature.
How should you lay out your Git repo? How do you create loosely coupled services? How do you support deploying your service at any time?
In this talk, we’ll talk about these questions and more. We’ll discuss the journey towards a rapid development workflow, discuss best practices, and, talk about the process we followed to get to a rapid development workflow.</description>

      <description>Developing meaningful SLIs is not an easy task, but your Error Budgets and your SLOs are only useful if they’re informed by good SLIs. In this talk we’ll be performing a deep dive on how to develop SLIs that actually reflect the journeys of your users. We’ll start by describing an example web service that should look familiar to you, identify the “low-hanging fruit” metrics you might be tempted to use, talk about the limitations of these low-hanging fruit, and conclude with some concrete examples of what useful SLIs for such a system might actually look like.</description>

How does one assess the damage and do the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest time? Good thing Dev Enablement has a lot in common with volunteer community-based emergency first responder teams! Both employ strategies of architectural damage assessment, emergency triage and prioritized resource allocation in order to respond to big disasters involving critical infrastructure.</description>

      <description>A look at the last 10 years of Devops. What have we learned in the Devops movement from around 2007. Early Cfengine saturation based on principles of convergence, desired state and idempotency. Puppet becomes mainstream in 2008-2010 replacing a lot of Cfegnine for early web-scale IaaS. Chef in 2009 driving reusable infrastructure with recipes and cookbooks. Continuous Delivery becomes mainstream around 2010. Containers and immutable delivery models 2015-2016. Deming and Goldratt influence on Devops via Gene Kim.</description>

      <description>If you thought that last year’s thoughts were deep, wait until you hear this year’s. Not Jack Handey returns with another ignite full of one-liner jokes and fun “facts” about devops inspired by the SNL segments of yesteryear.
This talk is primarily tongue-in-cheek humor and will be comprised of “deep thoughts” that are entirely new to Chicago (aside from maybe one or two favorites from last year). There will be some “thoughts” pulled from other iterations of Devops Deep Thoughts and many entirely new “thoughts”.</description>

      <description>As DevOps becomes increasingly established in enterprises, its practitioners are increasingly finding their products absorbed into traditional IT support structures, and themselves expected to act as part of a classic multi-tier support structure. This presentation explores the problems this creates: its siloed nature creates inefficient work-in-progress queues, and reduces cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing. An alternative is Swarming: an methodology now emerging in forward-looking enterprises, which sets out to dismantle the tiered approach, replacing it with something much more dynamic, lean, and cross-functional.</description>

      <description>Devops is now officially 10 years old. What have we learned? Although prescriptive practices like Lean, Agile, SAFE and even DevOps may be necessary for IT acceleration they are in most cases are not sufficient for long-term systemic improvement. In other words, you can’t Lean, Agile, SAFE or Devops your way around institutionalized organizational habits. Therefore, the key to long-term improvement lies in an understanding where human capital interconnects with technology.</description>

Farei uma demonstração utilizando múltiplos clusters kubernetes federados, uma aplicação com múltiplos componentes espalhados e coordenados por ele e, de outro lado, o Chaos Engineering buscando derrubar a infraestrutura, mostrando ao público a resiliência e alta disponibilidade geográfica, mesmo em casos de perdas de regiões inteiras.</description>

      <description>Most people never have reason to question whether the rest of the world thinks in the same way as them. Sure, others may have different opinions, experiences, and skills, but at the end of the day, their brains work pretty similarly. For those of us who are neurodivergent, however, we often feel different and alone in our experiences, and when we fail at things that seem to come easily to everyone else, we&amp;rsquo;re left to conclude that we must be broken.</description>

DX) is a core strategy in any organization to enable the business reach a faster go to market, lower the cost, increase the quality, increase resilience and of course increase customer satisfaction. To achieve that new competencies are needed which revolve around agility, innovation, customer-centric, being people oriented and resilience.
DevOps comes in place as a natural step after agile movement to sustain the fast flow created through agile development methodologies.</description>

      <description>Waffle House has a hurricane disaster plan. It has everything that you want from your IT disaster plans, including contact trees, failover states, and runbooks on partial operation. I think if we took some time to look at how other industries handle outages, we could construct better state machines about our own up/down conditions. I also think that we could use status instrumentation to trigger feature flags that route people to different versions of our products, depending on status.</description>

WHAT IS DISPOSABLE INFRASTRUCTURE &amp;amp; HOW IS IT POSSIBLE To get the room on the same page I’ll start with my definition of disposable infrastructure, “Automating the process of provisioning, configuring, deploying, and tearing down cloud infrastructure and services.”. Essentially 1 script to go from 0 to live application and from live application back to 0 again.
I will make the case for disposable infrastructure starting with a survey of current infrastructure practices and their pain points.</description>

      <description>Serverless and FaaS naturally fit microservices architectures. Observability of such systems is very complicated, since each microservice is separated and working asynchronously from the others. Distributed tracing is a key approach to understand such systems. In serverless, there are new challenges and opportunities which make distributed tracing a very interesting and useful technique for high observability.</description>

      <description>As the cost of living in traditional technology hotbeds like Silicon Valley become increasingly unaffordable, companies are finding it attractive to become remote-friendly, if not outright remote-first. Notwithstanding the pushback from companies like IBM or Yahoo!, I believe this is a trend that promises to accelerate in the coming decades. Cities like Detroit, with a large concentration of talented people and a strong urban infrastructure, are well-positioned to take advantage of this trend.</description>

      <description>What do people think when they heard the term DevOps? Most people say DevOps is a new methodology for developing a software using a set of tools, run by a self managed tech savy team and try to automate every thing. In this circumstance do we still need a leader since everybody seems to be able to managed them self, having sophisticated skill and most of the task run by automated tools?</description>

      <description>Docker is very popular these days, but how many of us are really familiar with the basic building blocks of Linux containers and their implications? What&amp;rsquo;s missing in the good ol’ chroot jails? What are the available Copy-on-Write options and what are their pros and cons? Which syscalls allow us to manipulate Linux namespaces and what are their limitations? How do resource limits actually work? What different behaviours do containers and VMs have?</description>

      <description>When you treat docs like code, you multiply everyone’s efforts and streamline processes through collaboration, automation, and innovation. The benefits are real, but these efforts are complex. The ways you can leverage developer process and tools vary widely. Let&amp;rsquo;s unpack the absolute best situation for using a docs as code model. Then, we can walk through multiple considerations that may point you in one direction or another. We can talk about version control, publishing, REST API considerations, source formats, automation, quality controls and testing, and lessons learned.</description>

      <description>Organizations turn to DevOps to increase value and improve the customer experience by maximizing the speed of delivery without sacrificing quality. DevOps delivers by implementing continuous delivery pipeline, which requires continuous testing. But just what is continuous testing? Continuous testing requires not only continuous risk analysis, process improvement and automation throughout the development process; but also developing a culture in which the entire team is responsible for quality. Continuous testing is an approach to managing risk by focusing not only on eliminating testing bottlenecks but more importantly, increasing the effectiveness of our test processes.</description>

      <description>How to Cope Now You’re Responsible for Production
More and more developers are expected to be on-call, provide out-of-hours support, and respond to production outages. Without much experience handling incidents, it can be scary, intimidating, and feel like being dropped in the deep end. But it doesn’t have to be that way!
Over two years on the FT’s Content team, we’ve transformed our incident response – from a number of mildly terrifying multi-hour outages, to a stable platform where team members feel comfortable on-call.</description>

      <description>Many organizations have some kind of incident response process to coordinate during a major service outage. Some operationally mature companies incorporate a formal Incident Commander role in their process for a faster, more effective response. The Incident Commander serves as the final decision-maker during a major incident, delegating tasks and listening to input from subject matter experts in order to bring the incident to resolution. Whether or not a company has a formal process that includes an Incident Commander, most companies believe that your most senior engineer is best suited to lead an incident response.</description>

      <description>Etsy’s blameless post-mortems are a great step to helping teams transition from a culture of blame to a culture of learning. Still, if you are only capturing learnings after bad things happen, teams are missing an opportunity to implement and learn from regular retrospectives or after-action meetings. Learning isn’t only about capturing the problems experienced during a failure, it is about establishing a continual learning culture aimed at continuous improvement. This talk will go over lessons learned from a team that started with blameless post-mortems and migrated to more regular retrospectives.</description>

The Incident Commander serves as the final decision-maker during a major incident, delegating tasks and listening to input from subject matter experts in order to bring the incident to resolution. Whether or not a company has a formal process that includes an Incident Commander, most companies believe that your most senior engineer is best suited to lead an incident response.</description>

      <description>Build, Measure, Learn. The scientific method. We instrument the solutions we build to get quantitative feedback on how they are used. We listen to feedback from users and we interview them to get qualitative feedback. We monitor the CPU and RAM usage of our systems, set up logging and alerts the get feedback on how our production servers are doing. Lots of feedback loops are well described and very effective.</description>

      <description>Serverless has become a much discussed topic recently, and for good reason! But many serverless offerings have strict limitations on package size, processing power, installed packages, and general freedom, which limits what you can do with them. But what about if you want to write a web scraper using Headless Chrome? Well, it’s probably a bad idea, but it’s possible! We’ll discuss how to compile binaries that work around Lambda restrictions, tools you can use to explore features of a serverless environment, and show various ways to take advantage of resource sharing between different invocations of the function.</description>

      <description>I have a two-year-old daughter who adores Dr. Seuss. And as I was reading Cat in the Hat for the 214th time, I realized Dr. Seuss had it all figured out.
His words are odd. The cadence confusing. But there’s a gem hidden in all his children’s rhymes.
You see, Dr. Seuss would have made an excellent engineer.
Because great code isn’t about choosing the perfect method name or building out 95% test coverage.</description>

      <description>Ever been to a conference, get inspired, try to bring what you learned back to the office, only to be stymied by co-workers who aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in rocking the status quo? It turns out that people tend to resist change in patterns, and like any pattern they can be overcome by using other people&amp;rsquo;s experiences with those skeptics. This session will teach you how to identify the skeptics, how to counter them, and give you a strategic framework to convince your whole office.</description>

      <description>As more automation rolls out and new software applications become a more critical part of our lives, the impact of failures increases. Safety is a critical attribute and one of the definitions of a safe system is that it has dynamic non-events. Whatever happens to it, it still works. I will discuss the new view of safety, as the ability to build systems that maintain a margin, and how to think about measuring safety and availability of critical systems.</description>

      <description>Running security tests as a part of your CI pipeline allows you to provide better and more relevant feedback to developers as quickly as possible (also known as the “Shift Left paradigm”/”DevSecOps” methodology).
But how do you start? Security testing seems so complex and expensive!
In this session, I will show you how to use Zap as a part of your CI pipeline to create automated security testing for your Web App or REST API.</description>

Kubernetes peut donc être utilisé pour déployer vos composants applicatifs, mais également les technologies d’infrastructure qui les soutiennent, y compris quand ces technologies ont été conçues avant l’émergence de Kubernetes.
L’exercice d’intégration d’une technologie legacy dans Kubernetes est intéressant pour 2 raisons :</description>

      <description>CEO and Security &amp; Data Protection Consultant at Securesult B.V. Edward van Deursen bought his first computer in the 80’s, a Commodore64. That’s where his passion for computers begun. In the late 80’s he started his career as a Cobol programmer on mainframes and mini systems. Later he developed software in C/C++ for PC’s. In 2006 he swapped to QA with roles like tester, test manager and QA manager. In these roles, he discovered that most product owners are focused on functionality and not on performance and security.</description>

      <description>Containers provide much better elasticity and density than VMs, but JVM-based applications are not fully container-ready. The first issue is that HotSpot JVM doesn’t release unused committed heap memory automatically. Second, it is not possible to increase the size of the JVM heap at runtime. To solve these two major issues and make JVM more container-friendly, a new patch is implemented for the Garbage-First collector in OpenJDK. This session shares details of what is done and how the added improvements enhance resource consumption efficiency.</description>

      <description>When a SaaS company determines there is a compelling business need for an On-Premises delivery option, the reality is that any technical solution for supporting both Saas and On-Prem will be both difficult and expensive. There are, however, ways to limit the expense and pain. I will share one solution that leverages Docker images and On-Prem Docker orchestration technology to manage complexity of the application codebase and architecture for both SaaS and On-Prem.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT Over the past several years, GM Financial IT has been on a mission to deliver faster and better quality products to the business to support the demand of the always changing financial market. As we quickly progressed in build and release automation, we found the new bottleneck of manual quality testing, which is time consuming and prone to user error. With the backing of senior management, a new team of Software Development Engineers were tasked with resolving our testing delays though automation.</description>

      <description>DevOps is about creating a culture of shared responsibility in delivery teams. It is recommended to embed operations skills into delivery teams to reduce friction and enable them to deliver products to customers faster but whenever there is a need for significant investment in tooling and automation and teams lack the skills to self-manage a full application and operations stack, having a separate Platform engineering team can help. Organizations that consider establishing such a platform engineering team should be very cautious not to accidentally create a separate DevOps team.</description>

      <description>Workshops are a great way of developing skills and sharing knowledge within your organisation, and they also encourage a culture of learning together. But running a workshop by yourself can seem daunting, especially if you aren’t an expert in the area you want your organisation to get better at.
I’ll talk about my experience of running a web security workshop at the UK’s Government Digital Service, what we did to improve our culture of learning and how you can do something similar where you work.</description>

      <description>The rise of DevOps and Cloud Native technology means that organizations increasingly rely on decentralized teams to manage deployments of complex distributed systems through fully-automated, self-service platforms like Kubernetes. At the same time, organizations still require tight control over their apps and infrastructure to satisfy important requirements around performance, cost, and security. As projects in the container and microservice spaces mature, extensibility has become a critical feature that platform engineers and administrators leverage to enforce their organization’s custom policies.</description>

      <description>How do you make the process of getting code into production seamless as a developer, without causing difficulties for operations? For example, developers would rather avoid gatekeeping in order to have shorter feedback loops. Ops teams would rather be well prepared for what&amp;rsquo;s going into production and when, in order to avoid surprises and prepare support training. In this talk you will learn about the process of creating a deployment pipeline for Kubernetes using Gitlab CI, what checks you can use to catch human error early, and ways of validating that changes won�t cause the result to tip over.</description>

      <description>When we engineer for laziness, what we’re really doing is empathizing for a developer’s time. No one wants to set up a test environment if it involves jumping through multiple hoops. Getting developers to write tests is hard enough - why make it harder for them? This talk will give practical steps in building testing infrastructure that’s as friction free as possible.</description>

      <description>What makes a hacker successful? When we say that we’ve hacked something together, or that an implementation is “kind of a hack”, we’re referring to messiness or a lack of design, but there’s striking beauty in the inherent ingenuity of a good hack. It’s fresh and creative… Where does this come from?
In our occupations and endeavors, we often find ourselves running into unexpected issues or grappling with hindrances that are difficult to define.</description>

      <description>Within a cloud system, components generate many discrete metrics, which all may relate to a single event, call, or incident. A single event or sequence of events is not always sufficient.
In a cloud based voice and video platform, network loss, jitter and delay negatively impact the customer experience, so measurements at multiple points in the path are required. Data needs to be collected and combined, and potentially enriched with customer and path data to allow aggregation of measurements from several different sources into useful human interpretable statistics.</description>

      <description>“That would never work here.” You’ve likely heard this sentiment echo from your company’s conference rooms or board rooms (or maybe you’ve said it yourself). There are always reasons: established processes (with vested interests supporting them), legacy codebases and data centers (both with large install footprints), and scale (for some values of scale), to name just a few.
Good news: change is possible. Donovan Brown walks you through a case study from Microsoft’s Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).</description>

      <description>The decision to begin automating deployments seems fairly straight-forward and simple. This talk will cover the unforeseen consequences of that decision and the challenges of automating builds and deployments across heterozygous environments, languages and platforms. Starting with how do you make time for automation, the talk will touch on the need for automated testing, static code analysis, configuration management, artifact repositories and other technologies. Automation isn’t the answer to your DevOps problem, it is the start of your journey.</description>

      <description>As we move firmly into the era of highly-distributed systems with very large numbers of systems to manage, new questions about how to manage the full lifecycle of an application stack healthy and performant. In order to do so, automation systems need to themselves adapt so that they can be reactive to changes in the system in near real-time.
In my work at SaltStack, one key response to this need is the concept of event-driven automation.</description>

      <description>Scars result from trauma to our bodies.
Organizational scars are the same. The way we structure our organizations and systems is a reaction to things that went wrong before. We hope to avoid the same mistakes, so we put in a bunch of process and checks around the known problem. Eventually, the organization changes enough that we don&amp;rsquo;t remember why that process exists, but we still keep it.
This talk explores some industry-standard practices around code repositories, branching, and why we handle code the way we do and what it says about the past traumas of our organization and how much &amp;ldquo;best practice&amp;rdquo; and tools affect each other.</description>

      <description>As we continue to work on improving our technology processes, there is much we can learn from the discipline of product management. I believe that by applying the techniques and approach of treating your infrastructure and service offerings as products, we can provide a more delightful experience and continuously improve.
Using principles and concepts from people like Marty Kagan and other experts in the product space, I will demonstrate applicable examples of applying the concepts of feedback, planning, and iterative improvement to practices including software delivery process, service desk response, and infrastructure as code.</description>

      <description>Our systems don’t have to be perfect to be operational - planes, networks, and elite athletes all function at extremely high levels even though they are not operating at 100%.
As an industry, we have moved the locus of control from hardware to operating system to virtual machine, to container, to orchestration, and now we are approaching serverless. None of that has reduced the amount of work that must happen, it just makes it possible to re-use and conceptually compress the work of others.</description>

      <description>Quality Assurance is a crucial component in releasing software. But who is responsible for QA processes, tools, and methodologies when you&amp;rsquo;re a young startup with limited bandwidth? The answer is: everyone. At Sensu, we experienced the painful process of discovering this in preparation for our General Availability release when engineers naturally were heads down in development, creating mounting technical debt with regard to testing.
The evolution of QA at Sensu is a story of identifying process challenges, researching multiple solutions, and implementing efficiencies in order to provide confidence in the product we&amp;rsquo;ve built.</description>

      <description>CD practices can evolve from controlled rollouts to controlled experiments. The impact of new functionality is measured against business metrics such as conversions or subscription rates. Dev &amp;amp; product management work hand in hand with definition and analysis to make outcome-based product decisions.
Controlled rollouts using feature flags are a fundamental requirement for continuous delivery. Separating feature release from code deploy means code can be incrementally merged into the main branch but kept dark from customers until fully tested.</description>

      <description>The “right” architecture and organization depends on the size and scale of your company. The only constant is change, and what works for 5 engineers does not work for 5000. Based upon lessons from Google and eBay, learn how to evolve both technology and organization together successfully.
This presentation is based on many hard-won lessons by the speaker, who led large-scale engineering teams at Google and eBay, but also co-founded a tiny startup and tried (unsuccessfully) to apply the same techniques.</description>

      <description>Maintaining and evolving microservices is challenging no matter how many services make up your architecture, but as the number reaches into the hundreds, the complexity increases exponentially. How do you evolve an API safely against a diverse group of consumers, each with varying expectations? How can you keep up with an ever-evolving network of dependencies, with new contracts, interactions and expectations being added weekly?
In this talk, we will share some of the triumphs and tribulations encountered at ITHAKA when tackling these challenges.</description>

      <description>Modifying the schema of a production database is hard. If something goes wrong, the impact on both customers and the team can be enormous. And it can be hard or even impossible to rollback a database schema change if things go wrong. And the same is true for any architectural change for a production application.
The Branch by Abstraction and Strangler Pattern makes significant application changes easier. Are there any similar patterns we can use to make production database changes less risky?</description>

      <description>Do you recognize this? Business are demanding ever shorter release cycles for new applications. Traditionally ‘Operations’ is seen as a barrier with lengthy bureaucratic controls and delays in provisioning production systems. DevOps is a growing movement for shortening development and deployment and integrating Development and Operations to deliver high quality software.
However, this requires a mindset shift, new behaviors and a cultural shift in both Development and Operations. Traditionally suspicious of each other, they must now work closely together.</description>

      <description>Software expertise is a vital component of a software project success. Software products are created by people – their skills and talents determine the result to a large extent. However, people can’t really be attached to a project forever; they change work places and companies, taking their knowledge with them. It’s a well-known fact that subject domain experts are important and dangerous at the same time. In this presentation I will share my experience of dealing with highly qualified programmers and transferring their knowledge to project artifacts.</description>

Time-to-market can now be measured in hours or days and that means software teams need to ensure very rapid delivery without compromising on cost, quality, and schedule.
Extreme Automation is the only solution to overcome this seemingly impossible challenge.</description>

      <description>There is a common practice to look at what “MVP” is. MVP works great when everyone believes in the concept. Selling infrastructure automation to leadership that doesn’t necessarily see the value is about selling the vision of what it can be. Would you rather hear about an end-to-end stack deployment in sub 2 minutes, or an MVP? The balance is how to sell the most realistic version of end-state without knowing if it is attainable.</description>

      <description>Faking it has always been considered a bad thing, used by lazy or incompetent people to market themselves as achievers. This 5 minute lightning talk will present a new perspective: faking it as an essential part of learning. By following a few simple rules, I believe you can appear more knowledgeable, while constantly attaining knowledge. And I can prove it.</description>

      <description>If your Continuous Integration pipeline is slow, you are basically wasting money! A CI pipeline is an essential tool for any modern development team, as the necessary quality assurance mechanism that ensures they can deliver working software. Slow, (or, worse, broken) pipelines cause serious impediment to development teams, and this impediment directly translates into wasted money.</description>

      <description>On March 18, 2018 in Tempe, Arizona, a self-driving vehicle owned by Uber fatally hit a pedestrian. Who is at fault? &amp;ldquo;Handoff/handover” issues make human-assisted Autonomous Vehicles (AV) more accident prone than fully-AV systems. People within the automotive industry know this, but most AV tests currently being conducted rely on a human assistant in the driver seat, given the ridiculous task of taking over the car in the case of an emergency.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;DevOps Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Work.&amp;rdquo; Whether it&amp;rsquo;s from people who&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;DevOps Transformation&amp;rdquo; consisted of a renaming, or people who scoffed at the idea of letting development deploy to Prod more often, I hear this all the time. And frankly, I&amp;rsquo;m tired of &amp;ldquo;What is DevOps&amp;rdquo; talks.
DevOps is a straw man person. When a SysAdmin says &amp;ldquo;DevOps doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&amp;rdquo; or grumbles about giving access to Production to people, the real problem is that historically they have been outnumbered, overridden, and have not had authority aligned with responsibility.</description>

      <description>You own your availability but when is it better to leave your infrastructure primarily in the hands of AWS by building a serverless system? We’ll explore this question using the analogy of flying versus driving to your destination. Flying requires you to put your safety in the hands of a pilot, flight crew, and airline and is routinely a safer form of transportation. Yet, many are still wary and prefer to drive which enables them to own their travel.</description>

      <description>Going serverless is a lot like deciding to fly instead of driving. Flying is routinely safer than driving to your destination but requires a high level of trust in your airline and many are still scared. We’ll explore going serverless by confronting fears and examining it’s new issues.

      <description>Do you wake up in a cold sweat when you think about what would happen if one of your devops people were to suddenly vanish, or win the lottery? Could you carry on? Can anyone on your team take vacations to cell-phone dead spots? Devops is such a dynamic and flexible part of an organization that it is the absolute hardest thing to get documented, and the place where it really makes a difference to burnout if you have managed the miracle.</description>

      <description>We fear robot overlords as we do vampires, werewolves, and other baddies that go bump in the night. We worry that their intelligence will take our jobs, our livelihood, our freedom, and enslave us to their bidding; or at least that’s how it happens in the movies. This talk addresses our relationship with computers as tools and how we should allow computers to do the work, so people can do the innovating.</description>

      <description>When humans are faced with a traumatic experience, our brains kick in with survival mechanisms. These mechanisms are the familiar fight or flight response, but can also include the freeze response - which occurs when we are terrified or feel that there is no chance of escape.
In this talk I will explain the background of fight, flight, and freeze, and how it applies to organizations. Based on my own experiences with post-traumatic stress (PTS), I will give examples and suggestions on how to identify your own organizational trauma and how to help heal it.</description>

Mike is an expert in preventing financial crime and money laundering and Jamie is an autistic developer who normally focuses on digital accessibility. They have been friends for over a decade.
While working together building a kit car called “ERMY” they got talking about work and discussed the frustration with the tools for monitoring financial activity.</description>

      <description>At Fire &amp;amp; Emergency NZ we wrote emergency response software to run on NZs fleet of fire trucks. Ironically while we were fighting fires literally we also had to fight them figuratively. Issues meant we had to re-engineer to be cloud centric, this was only possible because of our use of DevOps.</description>

      <description>Is site reliability engineering and serverless a match made in heaven or a disaster waiting to happen? In this talk we will discuss just what is this serverless thing anyway, why it maters and what it means for building reliable systems. We will also explore each of the SRE principals such as embracing risk, service level objectives, monitoring and others and map them to their serverless counterparts to identify challenges and best practices.</description>

      <description>There are many ways to measure the quality of a software product, but the first and foremost important factor is how the customers experience it. With both agile software development models &amp;amp; DevOps practices dominating the market, customers are more likely to keep up with the latest and greatest software versions from their vendors.
However, what would happen if this continuous upgrade process breaks (or better improves!) something at the customer side?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Serverless&amp;rdquo; functions allow users to easily create services from source code without dealing with packaging, deployment, scaling, etc.
Fission is a serverless function/FaaS framework built on Kubernetes. Users write functions and map them to HTTP routes. They don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with container images, registries or even learn Kubernetes in much detail.
Functions can be associated with HTTP routes, events, or timers. Functions consume CPU and memory resources only when running; they are started on-demand and killed when idle.</description>

We collect data and undertake research to understand earth and environmental processes. This information is used to create models, maps, and services for the public, industry and government. Software development in the organisation is diverse and varied, ranging from individual scientists’ models and simulations to public-facing websites, mobile apps and desktop applications.</description>

      <description>Whilst working in a tiny remote office for a small tech company I started writing sentences on sheets of A4 with a marker pen whenever I learned a hard lesson. I stuck them to the wall with BluTack so I had to look at them and maybe learnt something.

      <description>In the DevOps Handbook, Gene Kim introduces the Third Way - The Technical Practices of Continual Learning. Enter the DevOps Dojo - an immersive environment where whole teams come together to learn and practice their skills while solving real business problems.
Joel Tosi and Dion Stewart say teams learn better in the immersive eco-system of Dojos than they do using traditional forms of training. They explain why and how Dojos help teams bond around product, foster rapid experimentation, and reframe small failures as learning.</description>

      <description>In 2011 we delivered 2 major releases of our on premise enterprise software. Market, technology and customer requirements forced us to change that in order to remain competitive.
Now – in 2017 - we are deploying and providing feature releases every 2 weeks for both our on premise and SaaS-based offering. We deploy 170 SaaS production changes per day and have a DevOps pipeline that allows us to deploy a code change within 1h if necessary.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s dive deep into the guacamole rabbit hole of why we should be thinking about Taco Bell as our inspiration when building our microservices. Who else does such gastronomical acrobatics with such few ingredients?
As we continue down the route of microservices, containers, serverless and more, we need to remember and build on the premise that our microservices need to be just that: services that perform a small and specific function.</description>

      <description>According to Forrester&amp;rsquo;s state of Agile Report, 80% of systems development teams are using agile-based processes, while more than 60% of the SW projects are not delivering what is expected. Is it all about RM, CI, Infrastructure as a code, and CD,or it goes beyond that? This session will answer you.</description>

      <description>Everyone wants the shiniest new tech tools. As we iteratively improve, we can see how flawed our existing environments are, which leads us to action. But are we really taking the time to understand why “devops” matters or what it means for us (since everyone has a definition or three)? Do we know what kind of future we’re building?
We get excited about technical solutions that may diminish the challenges we face, but we need to start by examining our existing mentalities and underlying cognitive biases.</description>

      <description>HealthTech is a compliance heavy space, a small mishap can cause grave consequence. Protecting customer data is a top priority for companies in that space. “Bring our own dragons” which means never hand over our encryption keys is a principle we follow dearly. The secrets to access PHI and PII data are secured with multiple safeguards. The first attempt to protect secret was a homegrown disk encryption solution using LUKS and it has worked well for a few years.</description>

      <description>Cookie would like to review her findings and experience coming from a non-engineering background to changing careers through CodeClan, an intensive software development boot camp to obtaining a great opportunity at Adobe as a Junior DevOps Engineer.
With the need for skills and people with those skills, we as a tech community need to be able to facilitate and understand how we will meet those needs.
This talk can be seen as advice to her past self and future Junior DevOps engineers just starting out, things she has learned and that she needed to learn: What is DevOps?</description>

      <description>Nowadays, almost everyone uses tools like Terraform to automate the creation of their infrastructure. This includes servers, databases and other external cloud services. With the rise of Kubernetes, developers have to think less and less about their infrastructure. The question remains now: how do they access the credentials to connect to the rest of the infrastructure? In this talk we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how we at Manifold use Manifold to create our infrastructure using Terraform and connect this with Kubernetes using Custom Resource Definitions.</description>

      <description>As a container is tested and promoted through lifecycle environments, it is likely rebuilt at each stage along the way. This talk highlights what can cause a container to mutate from one build to another and makes a strong argument for promoting binaries as you need to move code through all the lifecycle environments in your CI pipeline. Attendees will examine the difficulties of using a standalone Docker registry to promote builds from one environment to another and will then see a demo of how to use Pulp and Crane to enhance this experience.</description>

      <description>DevOps is the union of people, process and products that enable continuous delivery of value to our end users. This ability is vital in today&amp;rsquo;s world, but it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to do. Learn how Microsoft transformed their entire company from a waterfall-oriented business&amp;ndash;delivering new versions once every 3 years&amp;ndash;to delivering new features every 3 weeks, with multiple bug fixes and patches deploying daily. This journey wasn&amp;rsquo;t a smooth one. Nor was it an easy.</description>

But then come’s to the rescue, the DevOps philosophy, to save us from the despair. Now, peace and calm rules, with CICD and plannings.
In 2012, a small company in Brazil was dealing with a chaotic, but a very common scenario, the lack of software development process.</description>

      <description>Considering that most containers in production weigh in at more than half a gigabyte, it seems fair to ask what containers at the opposite end of the spectrum can do. A fair amount, it turns out: at the very least, a REST service, batch processor and GUI. Best of all, Go makes this an easy target to hit.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT There is a fundamental shift in the requirements on developers. As team sizes shrink and responsibilities grow with the move to DevOps. Now a developer must become fluent in software testing, deployment, telemetry and even security. It is less about multi-layer and more about multi-discipline.

      <description>Systems are hungry for input. When they respond to unexpected input badly, an unfortunate human often has to intervene. Fuzzing can help us find problems before they happen, using randomness and program instrumentation. It&amp;rsquo;s a great fit for CI pipelines: you can run tests you never had to write!</description>

      <description>Organisations are preparing for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the latest European privacy law. Since organisations are already struggling with getting compliant to the security standards like ISO 27001&amp;frasl;2, NEN 7510 or Dutch baseline as BIR / BIG/ BIWA, it’s even harder to get the right measures in place for the GDPR.
In this presentation we start with the relationship between privacy and security. And why it is even more relevant to Shift left in the development lifecycle (Privacy by Design).</description>

      <description>In the devOps community, we talk about giving everyone a seat at the metaphorical table. It’s a way to bridge the gap between the dev and the ops, but we should be talking about something more tangible like gathering around a table of food.
When we talk about diversity and acceptance, we often hear of examples in hiring and decision biases and not harassing people, but how can we really connect with our co-workers that are different than us?</description>

      <description>Gemba translates to &amp;lsquo;the real place&amp;rsquo; in Japanese. Detectives refer to the crime scene as gemba, TV reporters report from gemba. So what does DevSecOps and I am the Calvary have in common with Gemba? In this talk, I will demonstrate that three different concepts are all arriving at the same destination and what that may indicate for security engineering practices.</description>

      <description>IGNITE TALK ABSTRACT Most of us use some sort of version control system; if you’re doing devops-y stuff, it’s likely you are using git. Using these follows a familiar pattern: You do some work, commit the work, and push it to a remote repository, perhaps creating a Pull Request or Merge Request for review.
Here’s the thing – what you put into your commit messages matters. Those commit messages are either love letters to your future self, or hate mail.</description>

      <description>One of challenges we had in our system is huge amount of parameters (literally tens of thousands). Such huge amount of parameters leads to long deployment preparation times. And things can still get &amp;ldquo;broken&amp;rdquo; too as system sometimes manipulates configuration on its own.
Of course the real solution is to deliver proper configuration automatically, but you need to start from somewhere.
The talk would share our experience from simply putting all of those parameters spread among hundreds of files into distributed version control.</description>

      <description>When it comes to monitoring your infrastructure, the word &amp;ldquo;observability&amp;rdquo; is showing up frequently in industry press. Chances are good you already have the beginnings of a system to enable observability in your system. You already have a monitoring system, how can this be extended to support observability?
This talk will cover how monitoring relates to observability and the different but related missions these two systems support. Famous monitoring tools like Nagios, Icinga, Solarwinds, and Xenoss all support monitoring, and may support observability as well.</description>

      <description>Sleep is the commission of Operations personnel. No company wants to pay for true 24&amp;frasl;7 operations (until they are huge), and more than that, seldom do they want to pay for senior members of an ops team to be working 24&amp;frasl;7. As an Ops guy, I spent 7 of the last 9 years in some kind of formal on-call rota. I want to share how I turned on-call from a lifestyle that required me to carry a heavy laptop and a loud mobile phone everywhere I went; living in perpetual fear of leaving my home, to being a way to get paid to sleep with management approval.</description>

      <description>Why don&amp;rsquo;t people around you act on good ideas and how to convince them that they should?
If you are going to drive change you may have to crush some eggs. You should not be angry with or fool someone, and you should always respect that others have different opinions than your own. Nevertheless, there is a high likelihood that you have good ideas and a will to contribute to the better, and that the people you try to convince wants to keep things as they are.</description>

      <description>Over the course of 2017, Coinbase experienced exponential user and trading volume growth, which in turn led to periods of website instability and downtime. To address these issues, Coinbase put together a specialized &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;Uptime Team&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; to focus on responding to incidents and improving reliability so that the rest of the company could continue to operate.
This talk will focus on our learnings throughout this experience and how we&amp;rsquo;ve leveraged them to build a new Site Reliability Team from scratch.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve transitioned over the last couple of years from an imperative Chef based flow with chaotic deployments to a serene GitOps based deployment configuration. As the number of teams, services and deploys was starting to grow at an alarming rate, we realized that something had to be done. We consolidated our deployment configuration to a singular Github repository where changes to all infrastructure and application deployments were maintained. This repository contains the desired state of all environments.</description>

      <description>DevOps teams need to have fast feedback on everything they do. Quick and reliable tests should be a part of these feedback loops. Also on your UI. UI testing has always been difficult, but with the right tools and processes teams can get back in control of these tests and deliver with high quality.
Receiving fast feedback is crucial for DevOps teams. In this workshop we are going to introduce a new tool that can be embedded in the Continuous Delivery processes of DevOps teams delivering web-apps.</description>

      <description>Even the most awesome tools and practices are useless if you can’t consistently deliver value. This simulation will give you a simple way to experience and demonstrate the importance of optimizing the flow of work through your organization and the items you need to run it with your teams back home.
Whether your organization makes software or widgets, it is important to focus on how efficiently you deliver. DevOps coupled with Agile principles provide powerful tools and approaches for creating value, but your work must be optimized to actually deliver that value efficiently and quickly.</description>

      <description>Continuous deployment of applications requires that teams are able to build, but that is far from the entire story.
In many real-life scenarios you need to connect the entire chain from development through traditional ITIL governed change management to a hosting provider that may not be entirely comfortable with continuous changes.

      <description>A silly ignite to continue the devopsdays Amsterdam tradition of bringing ̶d̶e̶v̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶o̶p̶s̶ Dutch and Non-dutch together.
Last year, I introduced the non-dutch members of the audience to the words, leuk, lekker and—most importantly—gezellig. This year, I hope to extend the DevOps tradition of bringing d̶e̶v̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶o̶p̶s̶ Dutch and Non-dutch together by discussing some quirky bits of Dutch culture and making tenuous connections to DevOps practices and lessons.</description>

      <description>As technology professionals, it is our responsibility to build systems capable of surviving in unreliable, unpredictable environments. Distributed, multi-regional systems are becoming more commonly requested by customers - from enterprises to SMB.
In this talk, we will discuss some actionable steps Developers, Architects, Site Reliability Engineers, and IT Engineers can make to reliably move their systems into a globally distributed deployment posture, and eventually into a multi-master active/active state.
Identifying seams in our application is a key skill Learn how to carve off pieces of your front-end applications and evolve them into stateless, durable edge services running on common technologies like Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>If you ever need to validate certificates or certificate chains before deploying them, Golang provides a near foolproof test method.
A 3rd party developed a tool that was then handed off to our DevOps team to manage and maintain. Before I could do any re-engineering work, I had to resolve a critical issue—the certificates on the ELBs were about to expire and needed updating.
I assumed that if the ELB, NGINX, or httpd started, it was a good sign.</description>

      <description>Gvisor was released 5 months ago and promoted with Google Cloud Platform&amp;rsquo;s push for python3.7 support. Google identified the need for a user-space kernel to act as a sandbox in container/docker environments. Gvisor is written in Golang, provides a swop in runtime for docker and provides a additional layer of kernel protection from your executed code. Google&amp;rsquo;s gvisor aims to protect the host kernel with &amp;ldquo;employs rule-based execution to provide defense-in-depth&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Lending Club runs 400+ microservices that comprise its online marketplace lending platform, the largest in America. Every one of these services has been developed, tested and deployed without drama. How? Our DevOps team uses graph database technology to manage infrastructure and operate the company.
Through our DevOps journey from monolith to microservices, datacenter to cloud, we learned that in order to automate all the things, we needed to have accurate and timely data about what exactly those things were.</description>

      <description>When we plan our agile sprints and staff our teams, do we leave time to operate safely? We know from rigorous data collection that long work hours contribute to a dramatically increased hazard rate, yet we work in a field that often glorifies and rewards all night server room firefights and epic code-crushing death marches. We might be working too hard to be secure. What if we could save money, improve security, and serve our customers better by working less?</description>

      <description>We spend so much of our time talking about distributed computing systems and their various components that we often lose sight of the human systems that drive their design. How can our knowledge about systems thinking in the computing world be applied to the often invisible systems that we operate in every day? Together we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the core concepts of systems thinking, how we apply that to computing systems. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll illuminate some of the human systems that drive our behaviors and what our new found knowledge can do to make these systems more efficient.</description>

      <description>You can&amp;rsquo;t build great software without understanding the architecture of the platform it runs on. Similarly, you can&amp;rsquo;t build great developer and user communities without understanding the psychology and behavioral forces behind in your audience.
In this new keynote from Jono Bacon, leading community strategy consultant and author, he delves into some of the most critical psychological forces commonly present in developer and user communities, unpicks them, and provides pragmatic recommendations for how to harness them in in building communities of users, developers, and ops.</description>

      <description>Being a good developer isn&amp;rsquo;t just about slinging code; we&amp;rsquo;re part of a community. Interacting with others in a community means feelings are involved.
But feelings are messy and uncomfortable, so why can&amp;rsquo;t you just ignore them? Because emotional skills are critical for working well on a team, and for writing code every day.
In this talk you’ll learn how emotions are affecting you by modeling them as an API and looking at the code.</description>

      <description>Open source communities attract and boast passionate, idealistic people, and many of us invest copious amounts of time and effort to contribute to our projects and support our communities. This underlying emotional attachment can make us more vulnerable to elevated stress, burnout and conflicts. And then there are those of us who also manage mental illness.
More often than not, we suffer these struggles in silence, feeling (and fearing) that we’re alone in our trouble.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes has become the most commonly used container orchestration platform. However, managing apps on it is not easy. A few common questions includes: how does one version the manifests? What happens when a deployment does not work as expected? etc. In this talk we will see how Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes, addresses these issues. We will talk about the use cases of Helm and it&amp;rsquo;s architecture. We will discuss some of the best practices around using Helm in a CI/CD pipeline.</description>

And everyone loves being helpful as well as receiving help, right? Unfortunately the act of trying to help can sometimes unintentionally cause more harm than good, leading to frustration and negative impacts on individuals, teams and businesses. In this talk, Paula will highlight some of the behaviours that we often see in the tech industry, describe how good intentions can go bad and suggest some simple guidelines to prevent this.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ll also explore the similarities to application development and show that even though there are challenges, it is possible to include your database in DevOps processes.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT “Five Nines” refers to the five nines in 99.999% available that is often synonymous with highly available. Does every highly available service require five nines? Not by a long shot. Yet the general state of the practice is to chase after this typically unrealistic goal almost blindly in many cases, often leading to unnecessarily high costs in both operational and development resources. Even less aggressive availability goals are often over-specified compared to true business drivers.</description>

      <description>Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) with associated Controllers can provide a more powerful alternative to templating YAML manifests in Kubernetes. This talk will cover how we use CRDs and Controllers at Manifold to define higher-order composite Kubernetes resources for our deployments at Manifold. These CRDs combine the definition of Deployments, Services, and Ingresses into a single resource that is continually reconciled by Kubernetes, preventing accidental deletion or modification of one of the components.</description>

Meduza is a small (10 people developers team) news media startup. Over a course of 3 years, our one full-time operations engineer managed to support 20 main services on the diverse technological stack - we have RoR, Ruby, Elixir, Python and golang powered Tier-1 services.</description>

      <title>How &#39;Up &amp; Running&#39; Culture is Devaluing Engineering Work</title>

      <description>More than ever, blog posts, workshops, tutorial videos, and books are presenting quick and easy ways to get started with new tools and technologies. While these types of media provide an excellent jumping off point for engineers to learn and experiment with new subjects, they also set unrealistic expectations about the complexity of the topics involved. Unfortunately, it is becoming more common for non-technical stakeholders to cite these works as evidence that engineering work should be completed faster and deadlines should be shorter.</description>

      <description>Richard Dawkins described memes as being a form of cultural propagation, which is a way for people to transmit social memories and cultural ideas to each other. Not unlike the way that DNA and life will spread from location to location, a meme idea will also travel from mind to mind.
Getting your organization to take a step back and look at how ops affects people (awareness of alert fatigue, burnout risk, proactive/reactive approaches) can be a tough challenge.</description>

      <description>DevOps culture is today a reality for many engineering teams. Yet, security practices are still unknown to many. Where to start? How can security be included in our day to day instead of “added” later? A Threat Modelling process is a proven and effective way that can help you transition to DevSecOps.</description>

      <description>Effective user authentication is a critical part of securing your data and infrastructure. Passwords are not enough any more, multi-factor auth is a must. This talk will dive into how FIDO U2F security keys work, why they are awesome, and how they defend against phishing attacks.
SMS codes and one-time-password apps are a great improvement over passwords alone, but the FIDO Alliance’s Universal Two Factor specification attempts to take it a step further.</description>

      <description>In 1985, TOMY released a toy robot called Chatbot. Just a simple toy, it never got to fulfill its true destiny as a conversational, artificial intelligent, chatbot - until now. Let me tell you the story of how I brought my robot kicking and screaming into the 21st century. First, by replacing its dusty, cold-war era circuits with internet-connected microprocessors, then giving it a brain running Node.js that connects to services to perform speech recognition, speech synthesis, and language understanding – making it a true chatbot.</description>

      <description>So often, we hear that culture is the most important part of DevOps. But how do we even know if we’re getting any better or if our initiatives are working if we don’t measure? The CAMS model of DevOps tells us that measurement is important. In this talk, Nicole will show you how you can get a two-fer! Measurement also shapes your culture.</description>

      <description>Suit or shirt, tea or coffee, cloud or on premise. Our whole life is a combination of conscious and subconscious decisions. They can be made through either an intuitive or reasoned process, or a combination of the two. Independent from the level of difficulty we fall victim to the same cognitive and personal biases. Especially personal and cultural decisions are sometimes hard to make, cause the establishment and enumeration of the underlying criteria is hard.</description>

      <description>As engineers, we’re often singularly obsessed with the idea that our job satisfaction comes solely from solving only the most interesting technical challenges. In reality, research shows that we perform best when we are rested, feel valued, and feel connected to a cause so we can focus on high-priority work.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the ways engineering teams and leadership can foster excellent working environments and cultures with minimally perceptible overhead, much like sneaking vegetables into desserts.</description>

      <description>Pretty much everyone use telemetry in software systems today – to understand where things break down, where performance or load are issues and if our components are working as expected. But this is just a fraction of what you can do with telemetry. Telemetry can help you understand why the adoption of your new ‘market breaking’ feature is not as expected, it can become a critical business tool to gather information about how to provide the most value to your users and how to make minimum viable products successful.</description>

But for all the talk of automation, scripting and serverless architectures, people miss the real value that good operations engineers bring to the table.

During this talk, I will share some success (and failure) in creating a DevOps culture throughout my career and also patterns which are symptomatic of a non DevOps culture.
Allowing your team to have access to a server; getting the QA, Ops and Developers to sit and work together; the ability to deploy your code to production without going through a 4h conference call.</description>

      <description>Errors happen in every application. In serverless, additional failures exist - timeouts, out of memory, and more. In many cases, errors are handled by the cloud vendor using a retry mechanism. Since the code is stateless, how can you be sure that the application actually works?</description>

      <title>How to design your team for scale </title>

      <description>When people talk about scale, they immediately think it means scaling in traffic, or sales growth. But there are many different intentions when talking about scale. Things like expanding teams and dividing them into squads, or technological expansion, or expanding business or product lines. All these are scaling up, but they mean very different things.
So as a leading engineer, you need to first identify what the scalability issue at hand is and what the tech team needs to do in order to solve this problem.</description>

      <description>This talk is an outline of some of the technical and non-technical things that Operation team members can do to continue to make themselves more valuable in their organization. The idea came to me when I was talking with someone who was new to the field that felt Operations work wouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist or it&amp;rsquo;s value would be diminished in the coming years. But there are plenty of things that internal OPS teams can do that will be difficult to commoditize by the likes of Amazon and Google.</description>

      <description>From years in the trenches of “test automation,” I found it broken by inefficiency, poor communication, and quality risk. I discovered and recorded the patterns of MetaAutomation to fix it and make quality feedback much faster, more reliable, richer, and more valuable across the larger team and distributed teams. The most fundamental change is to take a pattern that we all use in our daily lives, and apply it as we drive and measure the SUT to record all that valuable data and make it available to other parts of the quality automation problem space in a way that isn’t possible with the practices of today.</description>

      <description>The transformation of the way we do infrastructure ownership at PagerDuty was a perfect opportunity for us to think deeply about the processes of hiring for and operating our SRE team. With a change to the team’s mission (helping, advising, and speeding up instead of holding the keys to all things infrastructure) came new skill requirements for working effectively on the team, updated interview sessions using some of the same technology we use to manage PagerDuty’s servers, and new ways to manage our day-to-day work.</description>

It also could be called Scaled DevOps but that doesn&#39;t cover everything what we do. It has been a journey of 4-5 years going from change to change by experimentation. There are not that many good reads or people where to take advice from how to do this in a large enterprise.</description>

      <description>Security and AWS! Reports and alerts are useless if no one is fixing the issues found. Learn how The Guardian leveraged AWS tools to secure and centrally monitor multiple AWS accounts, then set out to inform and empower our engineering teams to adopt better security practices.
Good feedback is specific, timely and actionable, therefore Guardian Digital decided to distill and centralise the information coming from AWS. Discover how to get started with AWS StackSets, Trusted Advisor and Inspector, the benefits and pitfalls of these tools and why Guardian Digital decided to integrate them into a single application.</description>

      <description>Another day, another high-profile security incident. Forty percent of all data breach incidents occur from attacks on web applications. With DevOps accelerating the pace at which software is developed and deployed, it’s critical to integrate proper security thinking into the DevOps process. Without this, rapid software development can introduce security flaws.
The cybersecurity labor crunch is expected to hit 3.5 million unfilled jobs by 2021. So where do you turn for help when the demand for qualified cybersecurity professionals is high, but the supply is low?</description>

      <description>You will be taken through a process of identifying the manual parts of creating Docker images. The manual steps usually include building the image using the latest code, tagging the image and pushing the image to Docker hub. Jenkins can help us isolate these manual steps and automate them. Using Jenkins you can monitor changes in a github repo, when changes are merged into a branch trigger unit tests to run, once all unit tests pass build your new updated image, tag it and push it to Docker hub.</description>

      <description>In the early days of Netguru, we were a bunch of developers and didn’t even think of having a dedicated ops role - life was simple and easy. The company grew, so did our requirements and challenges, and that’s why we’ve decided to change this by introducing The DevOps Team. That’s also how we’ve entered a very dangerous path with a lot of obstacles related to technology, people, and culture.</description>

      <description>Software development is a social activity that favours direct human contact, yet 21st century life can often get in the way, forcing us to reconsider our communication patterns. Whether you are building a collocated, remote, or distributed team, there is one component in software development that remains unchanged: the human element.
Using the experiences of two team leaders from startup and enterprise contexts, this presentation will guide you to building happier, more resilient teams regardless of where its humans are located.</description>

      <description>Hybrid Cloud is awesome, but running applications across multiple clouds can be difficult. Features like Cloud bursting, high availability, federation etc. require highly skilled technical experts to deploy and manage - wouldn&#39;t it be great if there was a tool that could help? Fear no more, Kubernetes Federation is what you&#39;ve been looking for.
Kubernetes Federation makes it easy to manage and synchronise multiple clusters, enabling businesses to efficiently and cost-effectively deploy and manage applications across cloud providers and physical data centers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using functions as a service ( AWS Lambda ) for the past several months, and it&amp;rsquo;s led to a very nice flow for devops administrivia.
Even though serverless is a terrible description, and those no-ops people are crazy, functions as a service is still a super interesting approach, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re in the devops world. So many things that we need to accomplish are event driven, and we can lower both our capital costs, and our security exposures by using FaaS to accomplish them ( provided that you don&amp;rsquo;t give cloud-admin privileges to your Functions ).</description>

      <description>Code reviews can be a challenge to solicit for. Part of the reason for can be intimidation, or lack of confidence. As code authors, we want to reduce the barriers to getting a confident code review. My solution: The annotated code review! A simple process that&amp;rsquo;s got data supporting its strength as a way to reduce code defects, making for a smoother review process.
Introducing the subject with a story from a past workplace, where we experienced a major security incident as the result of code going un-reviewed, I will walk the audience through the process of annotating their pull requests, with some tips on what makes for a good annotation.</description>

      <description>Infrastructure as code (IaC). There&amp;rsquo;s an O&amp;rsquo;Reilly book about it, and it&amp;rsquo;s considered &amp;ldquo;a key attribute of enabling best practices of DevOps&amp;rdquo; by Wikipedia, so it must be awesome, mustn&amp;rsquo;t it? Ho wever, our experience at PagerDuty of moving towards infrastructure as code has not been smooth. In fact, there has been plenty of grumbling and pushing away from the everything-as-code appro ach. So is IaC the best thing since sliced bread or an abstract idea that does not survive the challenges of making day-to-day operations faster?</description>

      <title>I&#39;m Hunting Sasquatch – Finding Intermittent Issues Using Periodic Automation</title>

      <description>TALK DESCRIPTION Most test automation approaches with continuous integration are based on events: when a build is pushed, run the automated tests. By supplementing this approach with non-event-based automation, we increase our chances of reproducing intermittent issues provided we are judicious in our application.
In American pop culture, Sasquatch (also known as Bigfoot) is likely a non-existent, ape-like, creature infrequently seen in the Pacific Northwest of North America. In the software realm, we have our own version of Sasquatch: that irritating, “intermittent issue” occurring in the system.</description>

      <description>A lighthearted, comedic lightning talk about the various roles DevOps engineers play.
If an engineering org were a classic paper and pencil RPG party, what would you be? DevOps engineers would be a bard, because we dabble with pretty much everything: software engineering, operations, systems design, security, reliability, and support!
Being a bard means being vocal, opinionated even, about all of these things, because we’re interested and invested in all of the above.</description>

      <title>Ignite - DevOps em Enterprises: Problemas</title>

      <description>O movimento de DevOps foi bottom up, pois surgiu prioritariamente em pequenas empresas ou startups. Foi o modo que elas encontraram de tornar mais eficiente os seus processos e poder competir em segmentos diversos com grandes empresas. As grandes empresas, vendo esse movimento, começaram a se questionar se poderiam utilizar as mesmas técnicas e melhorar a sua entrega de software.
Porém desde questões como mudança no processo de desenvolvimento de software até mudança de cultura, para aproximar o cliente interno da TI, são difíceis de serem tratadas em ambientes enterprises, devido as complexidades corporativas acumuladas ao longo dos anos, e que muitas vezes, atrapalham diretamente o negócio, mas são difíceis de serem identificadas pela própria empresa.</description>

      <description>In this talk I will take the audience on a journey a single commit takes when it first leave the developer&amp;rsquo;s machine, and how it ends up in a production environment at the Directorate of Fisheries (Fiskeridirektoratet).
When a developer commits and pushes their changes the change is automatically picked up by the CI system that starts tugging along. Building, testing, more tests, and security scans are all run on the code before it continues it&amp;rsquo;s path to a running state.</description>

      <description>It is clear that Serverless is redefining DevOps. But, Serverless is not a silver bullet nor NoOps. Serverless removes some of the complexity but it brings whole different kind of challenges. While challenges are changing, DevOps is not going anywhere anytime soon!
The goal of this lightning talk is to make people realize that abstracting some of the complexity does not mean #NoOps. Starting with what Serverless is and is not, I will explain in which steps we need DevOps to the ultimate goal of running successful serverless applications on production.</description>

      <description>As we focus on how to how to best use JIRA, Hipchat, Slack, project management products, incident and defect tracking solutions, and a myriad of other software tools as a part of our development and delivery environment, we often lose sight of the most fundamental and powerful tool available – talking to people, to our team members, management, users, and other stakeholders. Rather than burying ourselves in tools and devices, software and search engines, we can do more for our overall application quality and delivery processes by simply talking to the people around us.</description>

      <description>United Flight 232 should have crashed with 296 lives lost. In contrast, Asiana Flight 214 should not have crashed at all. The critical difference between the two was the interactions of their respective aircrews. Aircrew resource management refers to how cockpit crew members work together to make flights as safe and efficient as possible. These principles have been applied to other professional fields, and should be a central practice of every DevOps team.</description>

      <description>Immutable infrastructure is a practice most commonly associated with public cloud workloads to eliminate the need to manage servers as pets. This talk walks through creating immutable on-prem workloads to provide the same benefits as well as greatly simplify the migration of workloads to the cloud.
The goal of the presentation is to provide an end to end example of how immutable infrastructure coupled with a CI/CD process can reduce template sprawl, simplify security patching and provide an audit trail for templates.</description>

      <description>Swapping nodes in and out of our SQL clusters is exactly what we did; running in prod with 0 downtime and through an automation framework.
While we were able to automate the building of a cluster to an hour in AWS it was still static and managing it became just like it was in the old hosting providing.
Often databases get forgotten about when it comes to automation and the app servers have all the fun but databases don’t always need to be pets.</description>

      <description>Continuous Integration and (especially) Continuous Delivery concepts involve substantial automation of traditionally manual tasks, including builds, code reviews, all kinds of testing, environment creation/maintenance, deployment and monitoring. While this is great at reducing cycle time, improving consistency, and driving better quality, it can pose some challenges to audit and compliance efforts at your organization.
Most standards, controls, policies, and procedures that govern IT interactions are designed to monitor and track the behaviors of people, not necessarily automated processes.</description>

      <description>Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) help developers automate the software release process. The faster you can release new features and fix bugs, the quicker you can innovate and respond to customer needs. Serverless computing has changed the game for application development, including how to properly perform CI/CD for your application. In this session, we will discuss a reference architecture for orchestrating the deployment of serverless applications running on AWS in a fully secure and automated fashion, using techniques such as canary deployments and automatic rollbacks.</description>

      <description>The Docker democratization started long ago with developers. Containerization is very popular for stateless applications but nowadays databases are also becoming an important part of the customer CI/CD pipeline. Fortunately, Microsoft kept up by providing the support for MSSQL databases on Docker regardless the underlying operating system (Windows and Linux).
But implementing a CI/CD pipeline with SQL Server raises a lot of considerations from both Devs and Ops. This session aims to provide feedbacks and challenges we faced during the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline including a SQL database project and SQL Server containers in order to reduce the time-to-market for customers.</description>

      <description>Many DevOps practitioners and advocates are blessed with operations teams on one one side and developemnt on the other. Some control the budget for dedicated hardware and support contracts for the tools they utilize. This can contrast sharply with small companies where DevOps is the only team out of necessity, and budgets can be lean. Fortunately, no company is too small to start leveraging DevOps methodologies for faster development and better uptime.</description>

      <description>In our work transforming our organisations, sometimes as an industry we appear to have forgotten that teams are still made up of individuals. That there is an “I” in team after all. That we are different to one another. That sometimes we need to work in different ways or different environments to each another.
The diversity that helps create amazing teams and products may ironically be being drummed of us by our own practices and environments.</description>

      <description>Software engineering teams are becoming more sophisticated about how they deploy software to production. This is reflected in the increasing complexity of software delivery pipelines that contain dozens of stages and advanced rollout strategies that are designed to ensure changes are quickly and safely rolled out to production with minimal human intervention.
Despite the importance of pipelines, measuring their performance and effectiveness is often an afterthought with few (if any) metrics, hard-to-understand logs, and (maybe) a neglected dashboard.</description>

      <description>At Go-Jek (a technology startup that specialises in ride-hailing, logistics and digital payments in Indonesia), we use InfluxDB for storing system, application and business metrics for monitoring and alerting, with 55,153 points per second being written into InfluxDB instance during peak time. Due to this we frequently faced the issue of high memory and disk space utilization. Instead of scaling the InfluxDB cluster horizontally, we solved the disk space problem of InfluxDB by downsampling our metrics data.</description>

É referência base para orquestração de containers, como também, para qualquer serviço que necessite SLAs cada vez mais alto. Estes conceitos aplicados exigem mudança cultural e técnico para equipes de desenvolvimento, infraestrutura e segurança para funcionar mas permitem cada vez a diminuição do Lead Time, antecipação de potenciais vulnerabilidades e principalmente: testes mais completos de toda stack de uma aplicação.</description>

      <description>Application and operations teams are at a crossroads of bring applications into &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; infrastructure and containerized applications. Much of the effort of configuration management is dealing with the shortcomings of packages and the underlying operating systems. With the rush to move everything to containers, operational concerns are often overlooked. Applications need to standardize their builds, their packaging, and how they are instrumented for observability.

      <description>The concept of Infrastructure as Code is not new to the world of DevOps. Many who understand it call Infrastructure as Code the fundamental practice of DevOps. Yet, there is still a lot of confusion about Infrastructure as Code. Many don&amp;rsquo;t understand what it is and how popular tools like Ansible, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes fit into this model. I created a simple Open Source tutorial about Infrastructure as Code that is designed to show people how Infrastructure as Code governs the modern infrastructure management.</description>

      <description>Containers are becoming the standard practice to build, manage, and deploy software especially as cloud adoption continues to accelerate. To help with this shift there have been a variety of services and tools created such as Kubernetes, Docker swarm, Nomad, in addition to cloud services such as Amazon’s Elastic Container service (ECS) and Google’s Container Engine (GKE). While these services and tools help with the orchestration and deployment of containers the underlying infrastructure management is often still left up the user and can add significant overhead.</description>

      <description>Success with DevOps can be measured with a number of different metrics. How frequently are systems audited for compliance to various policies? How long does it take to remediate a failing control or vulnerability? This workshop provide an introduction to practice of continuous compliance and remediation. The workshop uses InSpec and Chef for compliance and remediation, respectively. InSpec is an open-source testing framework for infrastructure with a human-readable language for specifying compliance, security and other policy requirements.</description>

      <description>The workshop will begin with setting up a Kubernetes cluster and understanding the components of the architecture. We’ll go through interacting with Kubernetes via kubectl, then we’ll cover Pods, Replica Sets, Services, Deployments, StatefulSets, Volumes and understand what the differences between them are before deploying each of these to our clusters. Next, we’ll deploy a basic application using some of these resource types, perform a blue/green deployment and a rollback, learn how to expose our application to the world and how to mount persistent storage.</description>

      <description>You’ve heard about this Kubernetes thing. You’ve seen that all major cloud providers have it in their offering. You’ve noticed that multiple vendors sell a boxed version with support. From time to time you run into the news that some company just migrated into it. And recently your good friend got it from github and is right now trying to deploy it. You did want to take a closer look last month but the deadlines and projects looming over you didn’t allow you to learn the details.</description>

      <description>Intro: Monitoring has always been vitally important to ensure the health and service continuity of computerized information systems. The onslaught of cloud-native computing paradigms such as containerization and microservices has further emphasized its importance, Moreover - modern scale and fluidity of IT systems has made traditional monitoring approaches and systems irrelevant.
Prometheus is an open source monitoring system for this new brave world. It aims to provide an end-to-end solution for instrumenting your cloud-native applications and infrastructure, gathering the data and translating it into actionable operational metrics.</description>

When speaking at a conference, folks often omit the everyday setbacks, the minor failures, the obstacles they couldn’t remove due to management or organization structure. Those get glossed over in the effort to show the success of the transformation. I want to dig into a transformation that is still underway, from, perhaps, an unlikely source. I work at Puppet, Inc.</description>

      <description>Listen closely. Close your eyes. I know you hear it coming. It&amp;rsquo;s the microservices buzz. Well, by now it is more of a quake.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been on 2 enterprise level microservices implementations. One was greenfield and the other was a migration from a FAT service. It turns out that the 2 easiest things to do when moving to microservices are to DECIDE to do it and to WRITE THE CODE. If you stick around after that, you better be ready for a ride!</description>

This talk explores code management strategies, deployment patterns, and cd pipelines you can use to make sure you can deploy right now.
People often say that they’re practicing continuous delivery, and then add something like “I can let the security team know any time” or “I just have to run the performance tests.</description>

      <description>The API economy is a general term that describes how organizations are leveraging APIs to drive profitability and growth. In the API economy, application programming interfaces (APIs) act as the glue that ties together services, intelligence, applications and systems. This allows businesses to make the most of their data to create enhanced customer experiences and open new revenue channels. APIs aren’t just viewed as technological assets anymore that are restricted to a company’s back end, but are being recognized as important sources of financial and strategic importance.</description>

      <description>Many of the poor security stances we see are the result of security paralysis. We’re presented with two options, being insecure or being secure, with little understanding of how to get from one state to another. With APTs, 0-days, logoed vulnerabilities that make us think we’re all gonna die, and the difficulties understanding these and other security subjects… Many of us choose to just work on other areas of our environment that need our attention because it’s not like there’s not enough work to do.</description>

      <description>Designing software is hard. Writing code is hard. Deciding on technical tradeoffs is hard. Timelines are hard. TL;DR: everything is hard. Let’s talk about it!
Writing design docs for software and planning for iterative releases means understanding technical tradeoffs behind each decision. To start, we need to understand our resource constraints and feature requirements. Moving forward, we need to plan the initial MVP, then map our route to iterative releases and improvements.</description>

      <title>KEYNOTE: Beyond Burnout</title>

      <description>In 2018, most of us understand what burnout is and why it’s an occupational hazard for site reliability engineers. But while we’re aware of how toil can sneak up on us, or how losing sleep to pages can destroy our productivity, we aren’t always as cognizant that we’re all starting from different baselines. Finding space in SRE can be challenging for people who struggle to read documentation quickly, or to speak up during meetings, or even have a face to face conversation at all.</description>

      <description>Growing up, I wore a lot of hand-me-downs. I thought I looked great – all three of my older siblings were cool. It didn’t matter how many times I tripped on my brother’s torn jnco jeans or how long my sister, six years older than me, laughed when I got my head stuck in the armhole of her WWF t-shirts. I wanted what they had because they were so influential in my life – even if I was never comfortable and nothing ever fit.</description>

      <description>All sorts of reasons are used to justify Enterprise Architecture. At the top of the list is usually a desire for high efficiency and minimization of risk. In other words, Enterprise Architecture knows best. We repeatedly end up in the model because, ultimately, you can’t have the wild west in large technology organizations. Or…can you?
Yes you can, with Simon Wardley’s Pioneers, Settlers, and Town Planners model. Take advantage of organizational theft to ensure amazing people in each of these three groups contribute to increasing the velocity and on-going sustainability of your organization.</description>

      <description>Once we’ve learned something, we often forget what it was like to not know, and how hard it was to learn. This “curse of knowledge” can impact the way we interact with our colleagues and our mentees. For our colleagues we consider “technical,” if their experience doesn’t overlap with us, there are often things that we find second nature that they have never experienced. This can lead to frustration, miscommunication, and sometimes equating competence with knowing potentially obscure definitions.</description>

      <description>Innovation, disruption, and discontinuity: Technology isn’t interesting. It’s the effects of technology, and the discontinuities they trigger, that alter fortunes, upend industries, and change society forever. A discontinuity is a change in how we think that makes the world unknowable and unrecognizable—but as this talk shows, there are ways to think about the future that help us prepare for such changes. It’s a wide-ranging, thought-provoking look at what the future might hold, and how to think about a world where unknowable change is the norm.</description>

      <description>Diversity is more than a buzzword, it’s a movement. Technological change and innovation continue as ‘tech’ is becoming integrated with every sector and industry. Inclusivity and low participation of women in the tech space has long been a challenge locally and abroad. Why diversity in tech? Not just because we believe representation to be fair and just, but because we believe that technology that is .created by people that accurately reflect society will result in better technology for all.</description>

      <description>Industry 4.0 is about moving from traditional automation designs to having intelligent autonomous systems that are operating side by side with human workers. The role of DevOps practitioner will be critical in the transition to Industry 4.0, but will require new mindsets, skills and tools that are not immediately apparent to those working solely in the cloud or datacenter.</description>

      <description>Vou apresentar uma visão na prática dos principais desafios e soluções encontradas, usando uma experiência durante 8 anos em 4 grandes empresas que ajudei a introduzir DevOps como solução de problemas culturais e técnicos, além de uma analogia com outras indústrias que passaram pelos mesmos desafios. DevOps vem se mostrando uma metodologia adotada por muitos times dentro e fora do país. Muita tecnologia, novas ferramentas para cuidar, novos processos, ajustes e uma penca de alteração na forma de desenvolver, entregar e operar software.</description>

      <description>Everything I need to know, I learned in Tanzania
I volunteered for a Tanzanian nonprofit that publishes teenager-focused magazines about sexuality and AIDS. My task: code an internal tool to track deliveries. My lesson: focus on people. On a used machine with corrupt RAM and no clock, we together developed a delivery-tracking system that has survived 8 years and several staffing changes. It lasts because its users care about it.</description>

      <description>TALK DESCRIPTION We all wish we could “install the DevOps”, but we can’t. If you compare the 2016 and 2017 State of DevOps reports, “low performers” are deploying more often, but their quality has gone down. Discipline and rigorous technical practices are required to achieve the benefits DevOps promises.
The military is the ultimate in command and control, making sure your every second is accounted for and every step planned.</description>

      <description>Ever find yourself thinking about things you know now that you wish you’d known at the start of your career? Or maybe you’re at the start of your career and you’re looking for some tips and advice to help you on your journey? In this talk, Paula will reflect on her career of 18 years in the technology industry and will share past experiences as well as lessons learned. Though technology itself has changed and continues to evolve at a fast pace as described by Moore’s Law, there are many areas such as balancing work and home life, working in a team, dealing with conflict etc that remain consistently challenging.</description>

      <description>For too long audits and security reviews have been seen as resistant or even blocking the frequent release of software. Auditors require access to static systems and environments, which would seem to make continuous delivery impossible. Too frequently audits are a fire drill reaction to the current state and temporary fixes are put in place to appease the compliance audit without being integrated into future releases.
What if auditing, compliance and security could be fully integrated into continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines?</description>

      <description>For the better part of a decade, devops captured our imagination about delivering better solutions with better organizations.
A lot has changed in the last few years and change does not appear to be slowing down soon. When we understand principles, we can derived relevant practices and tools, but that doesn’t mean we all need to start that work from the beginning.
How can our mindsets, skillsets and toolsets accommodate change without being overwhelmed or falling behind?</description>

      <description>Most people putting DevOps in place have only the foggiest notion of what it is beyond a “better mouse trap, and something about ‘culture.’” This talk uses failures and successes from DevOps-practicing organizations to give advice from the real world on practicing DevOps well.
“DevOps” has developed a broad definition that’s come to mean “whatever the things are we do that makes IT better.” While it’s annoying to have to spend the first 10 minutes of any conversation calibrating on what “DevOps” means, this points towards a broader need: organizations are desperate to improve how they create, deploy, and manage their custom written software.</description>

      <description>One of the implications of DevOps is a merger of development and corresponding operations teams into several build-it-and-run-it teams.
This means the typical tech organization that supports an old-guard business must reorganize to realize the full potential of DevOps.
It is insufficient to only aim for better engineering techniques and greater automation, hard as that may be in itself. The reorg is a challenge for large tech organizations that are often split down the middle in the form of a change organization and a run organization.</description>

      <description>DevOps is approaching 10 years old as a term, but it continues to evolve in response to the state of the software world. DevOps is the recognition of the way that developers, operations, and the business deliver features into production. There is no formal methodology, only sets of practice and principles of how we predictably ensure reliable delivery of business outcomes through IT.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look back at the changing landscape and the current hot topics of conversation:  Has DevOps gone mainstream?</description>

After several years of science-ing, Jez and Dr Nicole Forsgren have identified the key elements that enable not just higher throughput but also higher stability, availability and quality, lower cost, and happier teams. Discover how continuous delivery, cloud infrastructure, and effective management and leadership practices produce higher software delivery performance (and indeed what we might mean by performance), along with how to measure culture and its impact on IT and organizational culture.</description>

There is much hype around DevOps, so what are we actually talking about? DevOps improved Agile by speeding up deployment (and more). But how do you &#39;sell&#39; DevOps to business executives who don&#39;t understand IT?</description>

      <description>Software security risk management is a common concern across major organizations in the world. Most of these organizations implement some sort of software security program that includes activities such as penetration testing and vulnerability remediation, which typically occur late in the development cycle. Threat modeling allows us to design security into our software and therefore resolve security issues early, when they are relatively easy and cost-effective to address.
Security professionals have been presenting and publishing information on threat modeling for decades.</description>

      <description>Cloud providers have made it simple to host your app across the world. Unfortunately with that comes a proliferation of cloud accounts and regions within those that are all isolated. Because of this isolation, the management consoles tend to only give you information in one region and account. Come learn how Coinbase built a near realtime cache on top of AWS, avoided rate limits, and made the AWS API more developer friendly.</description>

      <description>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a techie in possession of any production code whatsoever must be in want of a container orchestration platform. What’s up for debate, according to noted thought leader Jane Austen, is how many pizzas the team is going to eat.
Let’s explore how to create and operate a Kubernetes cluster in order to answer this crucial question. If you’re into dev or ops or some portmanteau thereof, this is relevant to your interests.</description>

      <description>There are lots of guides and talks about getting Kubernetes installed and running, but there isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of information about logical next steps. This is a practical talk that covers common next steps like setting up access controls, metrics, logging, and more, based on experience running Kubernetes in production at multiple companies. This talk assumes a basic understanding of what Kubernetes is and some familiarity of Kubernetes resources.</description>

      <description>I worked for a large company with several hundred cron jobs running on two systems. Managing these jobs was cumbersome. Resource use during peak times brought things to a halt. Imagine what is was like when if systems were down! In this talk, we discuss Kubernetes’ killer feature: Cron Jobs.</description>

      <description>Artisanally hand-crafting our own container hosting solutions can be a fun learning experience, but for repeatable production use, let&amp;rsquo;s look at how to deploy and manage Kubernetes in a reproducible fashion.
Using Terraform, Helm, Draft, Brigade, Duffle, and more, we can deploy and update our Kubernetes clusters (AKS in my case; your mileage may vary!) and applications via a trusted, versioned, consistent process. The Kubernetes ecosystem is a complex space with a baffling array of options; we&amp;rsquo;ll look at a subset with an eye to repeatable &amp;ldquo;day two&amp;rdquo; operations.</description>

      <description>Are you a Docker aficionado or are you new to the Docker ecosystem? Come see how Kubernetes (K8s) adds a mature solution for running containers in production and development. We&amp;rsquo;ll start with containers, layer in pods, replica sets, deployments, and services. We&amp;rsquo;ll dig into minikube and kubernetes in docker desktop. You&amp;rsquo;ll leave with a solid understanding of the principles of K8s, and a practical set of skills for driving this container orchestrator throughout the software development lifecycle.</description>

      <description>&#34;Bonnier News is the largest news organisation in Sweden, publishing Dagens Nyheter and Expressen, two of the country’s largest newspapers. When we needed to build a new data processing platform that could accommodate the needs of many different, competing brands, we turned to Openshift and Kubernetes. In this presentation, we will describe the architectural tradeoffs and choices we made, and how we have been able to deploy data flows at a high rate by focusing on technical simplicity.</description>

      <description>At Datadog, we’re constantly battling to stay ahead of the growth of our customers. On the infrastructure team, we look for ways to leverage our small team to provide extraordinary benefits to the rest of the organization.
In this talk, we’ll explain our rationale for choosing Kubernetes as the base of our new global infrastructure. We’ll talk about the challenges of providing a consistent experience across multiple cloud providers that lead us to run Kubernetes ourselves.</description>

      <description>So you installed Kubernetes and gave people kubectl access to do their job. A job well done?
Not quite yet. There is no single continuous integration setup that works for everyone. In essence, you are trying to automate your company&amp;rsquo;s culture with your tooling. Meet Jinborov Karnovski in this ignite and see what&amp;rsquo;s beyond kubectl.

      <description>The world of containers is moving to the next phase. We now have an evolving toolbox. The question is now what do we do with this new tool box?
We need to think beyond just running containers and instead about how we use the patterns and primitives to automate all parts of application development and operations. In this talk, we will outline how Kubernetes was built to be built on and detail some of the innovative techniques and projects that are taking things to the next level.</description>

      <description>A mais de um ano atrás a Jusbrasil mudou de uma infraestrutura “in house” montada com ferramentas open source para uma infraestrutura como serviço utilizando o kubernetes.
Com essa mudança foi possível fazer deploys contínuos de mais de 400 aplicações com mais de 800 containers sem ter necessidade de uma equipe dedicada a infraestrutura e sem ferir a disponibilidade das aplicações em produção.
O objetivo dessa palestra é mostrar como essa infraestrutura funciona.</description>

Either way, Kārlis ended up with having everyday work concerned with management, development, maintenance and auditing of enterprise information systems. Seeing the not-so-encouraging failure/success rate of many development and implementation projects, one starts looking for better ways, innovation and opportunities for improvement.</description>

      <description>Discuss how layering control repos for configuration management can improve collaboration between teams. Allow different teams to focus on the config management that they care about, while using others code. Will show an example with Puppet, though this idea is universal to all CM tooling.
Show Rizzo, a tool that allows working with layered control repos with Puppet and Vagrant easier.</description>

      <description>When I was given my first technical team to lead many years ago, I didn’t know what to do. I copied the style of technical leads I worked with and what I could learn by reading USENET newsgroups about leadership (yes, it was that long ago). The results were mixed, and I felt that I was constantly making it up as I went along. However, after I began leading projects that used Agile software development, I eventually realized that the principles behind Agile provided powerful guidelines for leading my teams!</description>

      <description>All teams in an engineering org have their own defined set of responsibilities, but what about those areas of responsibility that must be shared, particularly security or, especially in smaller companies, on-call rotations? How do we instill a sense of ownership that transcends team boundaries without either letting the ball drop or seeing one team take up the slack for everyone else?
We’ll talk about how to drive a sense of shared responsibility with incentives and other positive reinforcement techniques to motivate everyone to do their part and make a sum bigger than the whole of its parts.</description>

      <description>This scenario might sound familiar: A critical system that is unstable but highly critical to the business. It&amp;rsquo;s running on old hardware and over time features and fixes got released making the code difficult to maintain. Traffic has increased and core components have become unreliable. It requires regular manual intervention to keep it running. It&amp;rsquo;s clearly a ticking bomb waiting to explode. Something needs to be done about this. This is our story of how when our team got ownership of such a system we embraced DevOps practices.</description>

      <description>Privilege is access to societal and economic benefits based on a characteristic you possess. The most well understood forms of privilege are the ones most people don’t choose for themselves like racial, gender, and physical privilege, but there are also selected privileges like religion, sexuality, and education.
This session will teach you how to lend your privilege. You’ll learn the various types of privilege lending including credibility lending (where you attach your name to a project being undertaken by someone without privilege) and access lending (where you provide access to a location or event for someone without privilege).</description>

      <description>Surveiller une application complexe n&amp;rsquo;est pas une tâche aisée, mais avec les bons outils, ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas si sorcier. Néanmoins, des périodes fortes telles que les opérations de type &amp;ldquo;Black Friday&amp;rdquo; (Vendredi noir) ou période de Noël peuvent pousser votre application aux limites de ce qu&amp;rsquo;elle peut supporter, ou pire, la faire crasher. Parce que le système est fortement sollicité, il génère encore davantage de logs qui peuvent également mettre à mal votre système de supervision.</description>

      <description>The seemingly endless series of small tasks that have to be completed before the next step in a project can move forward is getting larger, longer and more painful ! I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but shaving yak&amp;rsquo;s wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of my job description!
Let me help you bring in automation techniques with real customer war stories and live code examples that can help you spend more time delivering unicorns for your customers to ride and less time shaving yaks and other hairy beasts.</description>

      <description>During and after Hurricane Harvey, people from all over the world mobilized to help, including many technology professionals. This talk will discuss challenges and lessons learned from the chaotic first week of participating and organizing Houston’s tech response. We had to create flexible structures that allowed us to rapidly respond to changing needs, unpredictable volunteer capacity, and knowledge bottlenecks.
We created ways of rapidly disseminating information, even when our point people were stuck in meetings all day.</description>

Managing DevOps teams can be both challenging and rewarding. A relatively new field and a fast changing software landscape make leadership challenges here somewhat unique. This talk attempts to answer questions such as:</description>

This is just a fun talk to get people to think about doing and not just watching. Active, not passive. As much as I love to go to a Columbus Symphony Orchestra concert, it&amp;rsquo;s much better to play in the community band, even though I&amp;rsquo;m not nearly as good. It&amp;rsquo;s good to go to DevOpsDays, but it can be even better to participate - either as a speaker or as a volunteer.</description>

      <description>It all started with the best of intentions back in 2015. We wanted to do what was &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo;: Infrastructure as code and an automated way to do deployments with a microservices architecture. A lot of work was done and decisions that were made at that time allowed us to accomplish those goals in record time&amp;hellip; more or less. Three years later, we&amp;rsquo;ve outgrown that initial systemand a lot of decisions that were made with good intentions are hindering our growth today.</description>

To have a successful cloud journey, DevOps and automation play a key role, however many interesting challenges arise when you take a heavily regulated industry to cloud. In this talk I will share some of these challenges, horror stories and key lessons that I have learnt throughout this process including (but not limited to):</description>

When it is ready, fingers are crossed while it is put live by someone else in some other team, maybe in a different department. What if there was an alternative where everyone could put things live all day, every day?
Let me tell you how it affects people.

      <description>Blame is something that is ever present between Dev and Ops as well as within society as a whole. It’s devastating for productivity and personal development, it derails incident response, investigation and analysis. This is a tale of dev and ops and their quest to blame one another and its effects.</description>

      <description>I have been a part of teams where &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;scripts&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;, particular build and deploy scripts, lack automated tests. The question of how to improve the code arises and one answer usually ends up being a rewrite. I have seen several rewrites and during these:
1) requirements/existing features are missed
2) they take longer than expected
3) new bugs are introduced
The rewrites have been proposed because the code is perceived to be too big/complex to get tests around it.</description>

      <description>In DevOps, we know that these three things are true: systems are ephemeral; systems are homogeneous; and systems requirements are slow to change. But, what if these assumptions aren’t true at all?
Every field of practice has their own set of standard practices and common assumptions. In DevOps, I can think of three:
 Systems are homogeneous: Most IT and DevOps administrators are running many instances of systems that are the same or very similar.</description>

      <description>D&amp;amp;D is a brief concept discussed in SRE book. A number of engineering teams use this technique to prepare team members for going on-call. The idea is to re-investigate a recent on-call incident, with the team. The team tells the dungeon master what they would do or query to understand or solve the problem, and the dungeon master tells the team what happens with each action or observation.
In this highly interactive session, I will be acting as Dungeon master as we role-play some real life issues.</description>

There were many fixes discussed, but in the end using OSS and only minor changes to the code base and the infrastructure were needed. In the end we saved about $10,000 a month per colo and our ability to ship business logic rules went from minutes to seconds.</description>

      <description>Much of the organizational problems come from an unexpected place: The Erie Railroad company in the 1850&amp;rsquo;s. Since this first org-chart, we have sliced our businesses along functional roles. And since those roles vary from slice-to-slice, each slice is evaluated based on different measurements. This is fine, right up until two slices have a relationship in which their measurements - their incentives - conflict. In this talk, the audience will learn the source of this conflict, why the typical org-chart is causing more problems than it&amp;rsquo;s solving, how Product Teams help prevent code from becoming &amp;ldquo;Legacy&amp;rdquo;, and ensure that software is created sustainably.</description>

      <description>Software architecture. Software engineering. Software construction. Practitioners of the architecture, engineering, and construction of buildings might consider these terms to be overly lofty for the craft of software development. One of these industries is plagued by cost overruns, failed projects, religious battles over methodologies, dysfunctional teams, and unhappy clients, but is also innovative, socially conscious, and applying technology to solve real-world problems. And the other is software development.

      <description>“”
Estamos chegando em uma momento especial para nós, fãs de um bom futebol. Depois de uma grande decepção para os brasileiros, na última Copa do Mundo no Brasil, é hora de assistirmos as principais seleções na Copa da Mundo de Futebol na Rússia. Além da paixão futebolística, percebo que o futebol pode oferecer muitos paralelos com outros aspectos da vida, incluindo nossas vidas profissionais. O esporte pode até nos ensinar algo sobre Desenvolvimento de Software, Segurança, Infraestrutura de TI e também sobre a cultura DevOps, e é sobre isso que vamos falar.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how to use system data to uncover the deeper story of your product, to understand what users want without asking them and without guessing. Focusing on the &amp;lsquo;learn&amp;rsquo; aspect of the build-measure-learn development cycle, let&amp;rsquo;s make better use of system logs and other data to inform what we build. Think of it as bringing a deeper connection between roadmaps and a DevOps culture.</description>

      <description>Todos sabemos a importância que o tratamento adequado de logs tem, ainda mais em ambientes cada vez mais complexos e heterogêneos. Mas será que levamos tão a sério assim este elemento tão importante?
Nessa talk traremos a importância dos Logs e seu papel fundamental na melhora contínua dos nossos serviços e produtos, apresentando como podemos ser efetivos na hora de: interpretar a experiência do usuário; observar e entender o comportamento das nossas aplicações; como obter insumos para tomada de decisões em nossos produtos, e quanto pode nos custa essa prática.</description>

      <description>The products we build in DevOps teams can have long lifetime, but your teams don&amp;rsquo;t remain static. In reality that means the code will survive team changes due to employee turnover, shifting business priorities, and changing technology fashion. How does the mantra of &amp;lsquo;you build it, you own it&amp;rsquo; work when you have to hand ownership of existing code over to some new hires, and/or the people who built it leave the company?</description>

      <description>Agile and lean development approaches as well as DevOps often allude to the term called “whole team approach”, putting all the responsibilities inside the project team. For the classical software tester this usually implies being part of a project team instead of working in a quality assurance department. Being a member of a test center I witnessed first-hand the different drivers and directions of movement that have been pushing and pulling our department over the last three years during a still ongoing agile transformation.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of great things about the cloud, but the &amp;ldquo;destroy and rebuild&amp;rdquo; philosophy which is really good for building a continuous delivery pipeline, really sucks when applied to troubleshooting production problems. When your application goes haywire, the most valuable engineering skill is not the the ability to bring up a copy of your system or even the knowledge of a your technology stack (although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt). It is the skill of understanding and solving problems.</description>

      <description>A fully automated DevOps workflow gives teams a false sense of invulnerability to failure. A failure is an “all hands on deck” reaction, usually with a lot of raw data but few real clues about the cause of the failure. Too often rebooting the instances or similar unrelated action solves the problem, but doesn’t lead to a root cause. So it may happen again and again, without resolution.
There are two ways to become comfortable with failure.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;In what ways and to what purpose are the artifacts produced in a post-incident review process utilized in practice by software development and operations companies?&amp;rdquo;
This simple question (with a seemingly obvious answer) served as the launching point for months of research on what artifacts our industry produces when we hold incident postmortems and retrospectives, the various elements of those artifacts, and a weeks-long deep-dive into how three different teams within one organization actually use those artifacts to facilitate organizational learning, &amp;ldquo;learning from failure,&amp;rdquo; and improved incident response.</description>

      <description>Big companies are no longer guaranteed survival. Companies who move fast and pivot faster are disrupting them, largely due to an ability to make quick decisions. Unfortunately, too often, when companies grow larger their decision-making processes get slower. Lean leaders know that an ability to make quick decisions at scale comes when you empower those with the most information to make decisions but getting started can be terrifying. In this session, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to alleviate management fears and embark on a safe journey of distributed decision-making.</description>

      <description>Incidents happen and most of the time they get handled quickly by an individual or through an automation system. But sometimes none of that works and you need to call in the crisis team. Any highly functional team will need a leader. It&amp;rsquo;s not optional, especially in crisis. Decisions need to be made quickly and someone needs to coordinate efforts rather than getting knee-deep in technical issues.
When should you choose a leader, and when everyone is busy putting out the big fire, what should the leader actually be doing?</description>

      <description>Containers and Kubernetes are now the standard for handling applications and compute workloads. However, it is not clear how to containerise and operate databases. As more applications are migrated into containers and schedulers such as Kubernetes, handling state and persistent data is becoming an increasingly challenging problem.
This is a fundamentals workshop and is suitable for beginners and intermediate Kubernetes users interested in running databases in a containerised environment.
Join Joe Gardiner for a hands-on lab based workshop introducing the fundamentals of Portworx and how it can offer enterprise storage capabilities for Kubernetes.</description>

I work with &#39;Terraform&#39; and &#39;Packer&#39; on a daily basis since August 2015. I have created several open-source projects related to Terraform during last couple years. The most popular one is where I manage a collection of verified &#39;Terraform&#39; AWS modules (terraform-aws-modules on GitHub).</description>

      <description>Much has been said about the positive consumer impact made by the growth of the sharing economy. Uber and Lyft have transformed the way people get around - transportation is cheaper, more reliable, and more scalable than ever before. The same is becoming true of DevOps - by commoditizing Infrastructure and Reliability Engineering, we activate a step function in our collective experience of technol</description>

      <description>Think of Marie Curie. Would you expect to find a fascinating number of similarities between the Curie&amp;rsquo;s treatment of their work in the early 1900&amp;rsquo;s and today&amp;rsquo;s tech industry? I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t… Join Mandy Whaley to explore how the Curie&amp;rsquo;s used an approach similar to modern Open Source licensing to open the process for isolating radium to the scientific community, and how the limitations at the time on the rights of women to own intellectual property influenced this decision.</description>

      <description>DevOps trends are clear on measuring systems Mean Time To Recovery rather than Mean Time Between Failures. I argue that worrying about time between failures actually causes more harm than worrying about recovery. But do we think of our human systems the same way as our digital? I’ll apply lessons learned in SysOps to HumanOps.
I’ll talk about how our complex social systems act like complex computer systems and how focusing on MTTR rather than MTBF is a good thing between people, not just machines.</description>

      <description>We have a ton of options for provisioning machines once we have an SSH connection available, but how do we get those machines in the first place?
Meet Terraform from Hashicorp, your infrastructure automation engine. Providing a declarative interface for your infrastructure, you can define what you need and let Terraform take care of the rest.
In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at what Terraform can do for you, walking through your first Terraform configuration all the way to writing your own modules to encapsulate your infrastructure across multiple deployments.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;How are you doing?&amp;rdquo; is a question that is frequently asked but seldom heard. In our busy lives today working to solve devops related problems, many of us put aside &amp;ldquo;everything else&amp;rdquo;, to spend more time solving the problems with Kubernetes clusters, or writing code to minimize on call burdens. Then, we realize we&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;burned out&amp;rdquo;, and take time to fix ourselves. We notice coworkers completely burned out and realize they aren&amp;rsquo;t themselves anymore.</description>

      <description>We think in words, we talk with words, we understand the world thanks to words. Metaphors take words to the next level explaining concepts that were escaping our understanding before. In 1980 George Lakoff revolutionised the Linguistic and Philosophic worlds when he studied how metaphors affect our thinking, how they influence our actions and even shape who we are. What happens with the metaphors that we use in the Software Industry?</description>

      <description>Peter Drucker famously said “It’s impossible to improve what you can’t measure.” At the same time, measuring the wrong thing can create a world of pain, incentivizing teams to optimize for the wrong behaviours, or to game metrics they see as useless.
In this talk, I’ll share what I’ve learned about metrics that can be used to understand and improve an organization’s Continuous Delivery processes. I’ve selected these metrics based on interviews with more than a dozen DevOps practitioners and consultants conducted while developing an analytics offering for GoCD.</description>

      <description>When planning to utilize either microservices or another service-based architecture it is important to determine the size of the the services and the and frequency of the deployments. It is common for service-based applications to utilize multiple small deployments for services rather than a traditional all-in-one application deployment. It is critical to build a cooperative relationship between the development and operations teams. There are many decisions that need to be made jointly by the development and the operations teams such as how the services will be designed and deployed (i.</description>

      <description>Microservices and Kubernetes are transforming the way we approach application development and deployment.
However, automated testing of these types of services is challenging and often requires a mindset shift from traditional approaches to testing of monolithic based applications.
In this talk I will discuss the types of tests that make good candidates for automation in your pipeline, how much of each type of test you need, what tools can help, how to test your services in isolation, and how to avoid end-to-end integration hell.</description>

      <description>Handling deployments effectively is an essential aspect of making the most of modern microservice architectures. How do you safely and quickly deploy updates? How do you test that your microservices work at scale in a full production system? How do you measure and respond to problems occurring shortly after an update?
A lot of techniques and solutions to these problems get mentioned: deployments can be ramped, blue/green or canary. System tests can take place in a staging environment or may be eschewed in favour of &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;testing in production&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; techniques, such as chaos monkeys and shadowing.</description>

      <description>The tl;dr is &amp;ldquo;how microservices can better facilitate communication between team members and from team to team&amp;rdquo;.
Adopting microservices means a shift in architecture of our system and in communication. Letting your upstream and downstream dependencies know of major changes is not just a courtesy but required in order to keep things moving. Communicating early and often takes shape in strategies like versioning, informative deprecation warnings, temporarily providing backwards compatibility can all help enforce the coming changes.</description>

      <description>The usage of a microservices architecture is a significant paradigm change from a monolithic architecture approach. One of the key ingredients to get advantage of a microservices based architecture is the loose (data) coupling of the microservices. Traditional design methods with the usage of one central domain model for the whole system are contradictory to this requirement. Domain-driven design is one approach to design a distributed, decoupled domain model for a microservices based system.</description>

      <description>A ideia é mostra como foi feita a migração do Nubank para o Kubernetes. Hoje nos temos 8 clusters com mais de 800 aplicações e 200 desenvolvedores. A migração levou cerca de 1 ano e não teve nenhum downtime.
O Kubernetes já é adotado mundialmente e se consolidou como ferramenta para orquestração de containers. Mas como empresas que já tem sua operação funcionando podem fazer essa migração sem abrir mão de segurança e disponibilidade?</description>

Saber qual o momento certo e os passos que precisam ser dados para essa migração é o que pretendo abordar na palestra, levando os participantes a se motivar na implantação deste processo.
Mudanças não são fáceis, isso é um fato. Muitos são os fatores impeditivos (tempo, dinheiro, motivação da equipe, etc), porém se não dermos um passo nunca poderemos evoluir e ganhar espaço nesse mercado extremamente exigente e rigoroso.</description>

      <description>The promises of DevOps are clear - speed delivery of services and applications make dev and ops teams more responsive and drive experiences that your customers value. However, too often the full potential is not realized because DevOps teams are focused much more on “dev” and not nearly enough on “ops”. Do you have CD pipelines pushing code to dev environments only, and have separate processes for production deployment? Too often, DevOps is implemented only halfway, focused on improving the upstream communication between dev teams and their business counterparts but then failing to adequately loop in the downstream testing and operations teams.</description>

      <description>You’re probably familiar with Conway’s Law, that “organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.” But did you know that there’s a tradition in academia spanning as far back as the 1960’s that has studied it in action?
Our understanding began in the traditions of organisational design, product design, and organisations-as-complex-systems. Conway’s Law is a separate tradition in technology, embracing our idioms and ways of storytelling.</description>

      <description>As individuals and organizations get tactical and start looking at specific capabilities to build and practices to embrace, the problem quickly becomes ‘How do I do all of this?’ and ‘Where do I get started?’. One aspect of this problem is how to create room for continuous improvement alongside supporting BAU, and the other is how do you prioritize and manage continuous improvement initiatives against each other. While improving something is better than not improving anything at all, it’s important to demonstrate quick wins to build momentum and get others excited about the DevOps journey.</description>

      <description>Testing cloud-native distributed software architectures creates many headaches for developers. Accurately reproducing the production behavior of a modern application’s many dependencies in a controlled CI/CD test environment is a time consuming and error-prone task. Mock All The Things (MATT) is a new tool that lets you create integration/performance tests from your application’s real traffic with just a single command. MATT can then replay these integration tests in your CI/CD environment to ensure that your application always meets all functionality and performance requirements.</description>

      <description>The exponential grow of the numbers of servers and so-called micro services during the last years had drag some challenges on most of IT areas.
Monitoring been no exception, this critical part of any infrastructure required a huge an extra effort to migrate, as there was no place for monitoring blackout.
Our monitoring simply did not work, we were flood with timeouts as much as we kept adding services, becoming a pain of SRE on-call.</description>

      <description>Configuration management tools encourage us to automate everything, but what comes after your servers and applications are up and running? Monitoring is a key part of each deployment. However, often we tend to let it slide. One reason is t he effort it takes us to create even basic health checks. In private and public clouds servers and services appear and disappear in a fast frequency. In containerized environments, the amount of changes is even higher.</description>

      <description>In this talk, veteran DevOps engineer Guy Fighel dissects a few real world examples where not knowing what you don’t know led to massive outages and service disruptions. He’ll explore how despite the fact that modern DevOps teams have multiple monitoring tools, hundreds of metrics instrumented and are capturing billions of data points…downtime still happens. How about instead of implementing more monitoring, we bring forward a future where DevOps teams can augment their existing tooling with AI and machine learning to draw richer correlations across events, metrics and logs to surface insights about threats to uptime that aren’t even being monitored.</description>

      <description>When you rely on your users to do your monitoring (and even worse, your alerting) for you, do you really care about them?
That said, how would you go about fixing it? How do you identify what&amp;rsquo;s broken; how do you allocate the time to fix it? Are there shortcuts? (yes, if you ask for help).</description>

      <description>Monitoring applications running in a typical data center is a pretty static process. Monitoring in the cloud is a very different endeavor. Why? The dynamic nature of cloud computing makes keeping track of resources being monitored a non-trivial activity. Additionally, examining the dynamic changes of the cloud environment itself is a valuable tool for detecting and diagnosing problems, yet often is difficult to actually accomplish in a useful and compelling way.</description>

      <description>Like many modern development organizations, xMatters has been hard at work decomposing a monolithic application into many microservices. With this effort comes more autonomy for service-owning teams, but also more responsibilities. Tobias Dunn-Krahn and Mattius McLaughlin will talk about how their organization has transformed to face the challenge, as well as how to promote service ownership, balance operational concerns with feature velocity using SLIs/SLOs and avoiding callout fatigue.</description>

      <description>Most companies slow down as they get larger, but some actually get faster. This talk will discuss the speaker&amp;rsquo;s experiences leading high-performing engineering teams at Google, eBay, and Stitch Fix, and will discuss the organization, the processes, and the culture that can help a company move fast – and even accelerate – as it grows. Modern software-service models take advantage of the great benefits in having the same team both build the software as well as operate it in production – we call this DevOps, or simply &amp;ldquo;You Build It; You Run It&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>It’s no secret that writing modern containerized applications is winning the hearts and minds of developers around the world.
There is however a lack of knowledge around solving migration into the new promised land of cloud native computing. The point of this talk is to prototype an application that is designed to be as hard as possible to containerize. Then we liberate the application and explore problem spaces encountered along the way.</description>

      <description>In early 2010, Visual Studio Team Foundation Server was on-premises, boxed software. It shipped every two to three years. Today, Visual Studio Team Services is an online platform serving millions of accounts, deploying bug fixes on demand, and shipping new features every three weeks. Join me on the journey from boxed software to a highly-available continually evolving service using feature flags, deployment rings, testing-in-production, and more. Not only will we cover the cool, fun patterns, but we&amp;rsquo;ll dip into the pitfalls and challenges experienced.</description>

      <description>When healthcare.gov came out, it seemed like everything went wrong, but a few months later, people were getting healthcare, and the site continued to improve over time. A big part of the change was introducing the culture of DevOps into the government agency and contractors behind that website.
While there was some initial resistance, there was also real, lasting change for the better. In this talk, you&amp;rsquo;ll hear about how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services started to embrace DevOps and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn some principles of cultural change that you can apply to your own organization.</description>

      <description>In the brave new world of microservices, the need for polyglot solutions is growing, making it harder to standardize continuous delivery pipelines across many different languages and runtimes. Tasks like compiling, packaging, profiling or verifying software components, are now more diverse and our toolbelt as developers does not cease to grow. Thankfully, there are ways to prescribe and standardize without losing freedom and flexibility. In this talk we will showcase. from a very pragmatic and hands-on point of view, an architectural approach based on real-world project experiences, unleashing the power of Jenkins, Jenkinsfile declarative pipelines, Jenkins libraries, Docker and OpenShift, for continuously delivering polyglot components at ease.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of money floating around in the tech industry and employees are disadvantaged in a negotiation, since we don&amp;rsquo;t know what they have to offer you. I want to make the negotiation process in tech less of a mystery, so that everyone goes in prepared for the compensation talk.
By the end of my talk, the audience should know:
 What to ask for. How to ask for it.</description>

      <description>I have developed an infrastructure that provides automated audit of Network Configuration (Cisco, Arista and Juniper routers and switches) using Ansible and Jenkins. The audit is based on building a Golden configuration for the devices using Ansible and comparing the Golden configuration against active configuration in the network producing a context-sensitive result. A network-wide audit completes in less than 10 minutes using Jenkins, where the Jenkins jobs are also managed by software (JJB) and source controlled.</description>

      <description>It’s been gratifying to see the DevOps community take up the challenge of making empathy the essence of what we do. We should be proud of ourselves as an example to other organizational transformation approaches. We still, though, have room to grow. Whether it’s NoOps, or cloud-native chauvinism, or labeling people on the autism spectrum as lacking the capacity for empathy, we create subtle separations and exclusions through language and practice.</description>

      <title>New Rules of Engagement for Product Quality: Testing-as-a-Service in a DevOps Culture</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-seattle/program/ram-jothikumar/</link>

      <description>Traditional testing has generally meant a siloed activity, charged with ensuring shippable product quality. It has also been synonymous with words like ReleaseBlocker, ShipStopper and looked upon as a required time drain in product deployment life cycle. In most cases, without the proper process and cultural thinking in place, testing is still thought of as a blocker to shipping code.
In the DevOps world of modern micro-service based architecture and cloud based apps, this traditional thinking has long since been replaced with faster and more fluid testing practices.</description>

      <description>Taking News Feed&amp;rsquo;s various binaries from source-code to production is a quick, mostly automated process. Starting at one end of the push pipeline, a binary package must successfully traverse all of the various phases before potentially making it to production. From the source-code, binaries are built, packed, tested, and pushed multiple times per day. The process begins by building different “flavors” of packages with different compilers, flags, and sanitizers. After a bundle of these package are built, the push scheduler tests them with cloned production requests and nullified responses.</description>

This presentation will briefly discuss and demo a prototype of the language. We&amp;rsquo;ll also explain how the language is implemented in terms of the graph API, and how alternate inputs can be used. We&amp;rsquo;ll even show you how you can write pure golang code to libify mgmt.</description>

This presentation will have a large number of demos of the language. We will present a number of traditional use cases that were historically quite difficult to setup and deploy, but which can now be expressed as simple snippets of code. Examples will include service discovery, auto-scaling, provisioning, state-machines, scheduling and more!</description>

      <description>В докладе я хочу рассказать о том, как мы сэкономили кучу времени на разработке ПО выбрав удачную архитектуру платформы. В проекте AIRA огромное количество (сотни) зависимостей и модулей, управлять сборкой и вести это хозяйство не так просто. Я хочу рассказать об опыте создания продукта как дистрибутива GNU/Linux на базе NixOS на примере AIRA. О нашем непростом пути к этому, набитых шишках и вынесенных уроках. Тезисы:
 Умные фабрики и города, вызовы и требования к доставке ПО Чистый функциональный подход в работе DevOps и почему репозиторий пакетов как код это очень удобно Что такое Nix и как он экономит время разработчика, но не всегда так легко и очевидно, как пишут в книжках.</description>

      <description>API’s are everywhere!
We are living in the API Economy. Learn about the unique security challenges that exist in API-driven applications. In this talk, we will explore security vulnerabilities I&amp;rsquo;ve seen from pen-testing API’s, how to hack them and how to implement countermeasures to help developers to protect them.
API security is becoming an important topic with developers, DevOps and DevSecOps alike. Whether its communicating with other microservices, containers, cloud services, applications or data stores, API’s are everywhere in a modern DevOps stack.</description>

      <description>Many experts believed driving was too complex to be automated, yet here we are with self driving taxis, cars, and trucks. The robots are coming for drivers - and they are coming for you too. No matter what your job, a robot WILL do it. They will be stronger, faster, and smarter than you. They will be better writers, better doctors, and run companies more effectively.
We can delay the inevitable by shutting down borders and subsidizing losing industries, but we will not stop robots from replacing human labor (nor should we).</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all strategy for production observability, just like there&amp;rsquo;s no single correct production architecture, or database schema. In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll show how you can incrementally develop a structured logging and instrumentation API that works for your organization, and helps you solve the problems that you care about.
Using extensive code examples, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about strategies for keeping things simple, so that you can focus on solving business problems instead of prematurely scaling logging, metrics and tracing infrastructure.</description>

      <description>New systems are always interesting targets since their security model couldn’t mature yet. NoSQL databases are no exception and had some lurid articles about their security, but how does their protection actually look like? We will take a look at three widely used systems and their unique approaches: * MongoDB: Widely criticized for publicly accessible databases and a common victim of ransomware. Actually, it provides an elaborate authentication and authorization system, which we will cover from a historic perspective and put an emphasis on the current state.</description>

      <description>Docker and rkt have made it really easy to package and ship applications but running them at scale, remains a challenge. Also, not all organizations have the bandwidth to containerize their workloads. Nomad, a single binary cluster scheduler, can be used to build a multi region, self-healing production environment that runs a diverse set of workloads including non-containerized applications.
Anubhav Mishra offers a hands-on workshop on Nomad, a single binary cluster scheduler, to build a multi-region, self-healing production environment from scratch.</description>

      <description>Most people putting DevOps in place have only the foggiest notion of what it is beyond a &amp;ldquo;better mousetrap, and something about &amp;lsquo;culture.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; This talk uses failures and successes from DevOps-practicing organizations to give advice from the real world on getting DevOps started at your organization.
“DevOps” has developed a vulgar definition that’s come to mean “whatever the things are we do that makes IT better.” While it’s annoying to have to spend the first 10 minutes of any conversation calibrating on what “DevOps” means, this points towards a broader need: organizations are desperate to improve how they create, deploy, and manage their custom written software.</description>

      <description>The Guardian digital team have worked hard towards implementing Continuous Delivery, and now deploy hundreds of times a day. But if you ship this fast, you need to remove all obstacles to delivery. This talk looks looks skeptically at the role of testing in the world of CD, and asks “if can fix it quickly, why does it have to be perfect?&amp;rdquo;
It will look at how the move towards rapid deployment changed the way Guardian’s QA team thought about testing - and how they moved from being a conventional pre-release checking-and-testing function to being a team that considers quality in a much more broad sense.</description>

      <description>No one builds software completely from scratch anymore. The use of open source software is at an all-time high. The benefits in terms of time to market are too great to ignore. Open source isn&amp;rsquo;t a panacea though and in my experience too often the incorporated library is orphaned and left to fend for itself. As long as it functions properly, why would I ever revisit it?
Research conducted by Veracode shows that as much as 90% of an application is made up of third-party code including open source components and libraries.</description>

      <description>Most people putting DevOps in place have only the foggiest notion of what it is beyond a “better mouse trap, and something about ‘culture.’” This talk uses failures and successes from DevOps-practicing organizations to give advice from the real world on doing the DevOps real-good like.</description>

      <description>“DevOps” has developed a vulgar definition that’s come to mean “whatever the things are we do that makes IT better.” While it’s annoying to have to spend the first 10 minutes of any conversation calibrating on what “DevOps” means, this points towards a broader need: organizations are desperate to improve how they create, deploy, and manage their custom written software. The goals of DevOps align perfectly with this need, though as organizations who try to “scale” DevOps are finding, DevOps doesn’t solve all of your problems.</description>

      <title>Nudge theory: Influencing empowered teams to do the things that matter to you</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-london/program/sarah-wells/</link>

      <description>Successful DevOps means empowering teams. &amp;ldquo;You build it, you run it&amp;rdquo; is a fine principle, but it means you need to let your teams make their own choices. But you still have things you want all teams to do, and you need to balance the benefits of the right technologies against the costs of running multiple data stores, deployment platforms, languages, etc.
I’ll offer a brief overview of nudge theory and the EAST framework developed by the UK government’s Behavioural Insights team as a framework for influencing behaviour and explore what nudge theory can teach us about making it easy and attractive for disparate teams to do things for the common good.</description>

      <description>Sistemas operacionais tradicionais (Linux, FreeBSD, Windows) serão extintos em servidores. Eles serão substituídos por hypervisors do tipo bare metal, otimizados de forma específica para o hardware e o deploy de nossas aplicações será feito por meio de um único arquivo binário. Veremos o que são Unikernels, os motivos de serem rápidos, seguros e que oportunidades teremos no futuro.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;O que é qualidade de software&amp;rdquo; é uma pergunta que pode ser respondida de vários jeitos. Algumas pessoas vão citar testes automatizados, outras vão falar de software sem bugs, ou de entregas frequentes. Mas você já parou pra pensar o que realmente significa qualidade de software no seu projeto atual? Já pensou em que estratégia deveria abordar para conseguir a satisfação dos usuários? Claro que funcionalidade &amp;ldquo;funcionando&amp;rdquo; é muito importante, mas e além disso?</description>

      <description>Observability is the buzz these days. Everybody wants their code to explain to them what the issue is and how to fix it. But how do you get it right for your architecture, team structure and product maturity? I’ll share the path to observability at Snyk.io from day one to a team of 20 today.</description>

      <description>People have different tools to help understand production services. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard about request IDs, but maybe don&amp;rsquo;t know if that means you are &amp;ldquo;tracing&amp;rdquo; or not. We&amp;rsquo;ll cross the silos and see how different tools work independently and together to help you understand your services!
Let’s talk about often confused telemetry tools: Logging, Metrics and Distributed Tracing. We’ll show how you capture latency using each of the tools and how they work differently.</description>

      <description>Our systems are getting astronomically more complex. Modern development paradigms are pushing more and more technical debt into your operational future. In the future we are all distributed systems engineers &amp;hellip; but our tools for debugging and understanding them are relics of the more predictable LAMP stack era. What could possibly go wrong?? Let’s talk about the many disasters that await and befall us, the ways our tooling and organizational culture need to adapt to keep up, and how instrumentation and observability can help.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk about software ownership—but what does &amp;ldquo;owning code in production&amp;rdquo; really mean for developers, day to day? Many development teams still reach for logs in production as the most familiar way to bridge the development environment with production.
This talk will make the case that observability—and the skills to craft the right graphs and read them—benefits developers more than it does operators by examining several instances where well-informed devs can supercharge their development process:</description>

      <description>There are as many different ideas about DevOps out there as there are individuals. From people who hate the term and think it&amp;rsquo;s an empty buzzword to the evangelist, from people who work in a DevOps department to people who think a DevOps department misses the point entirely, it can be hard to figure out how to apply these ideas to your own organization.
I want to build the kind of IT environment that our employees brag about to their peers, that 99% of IT workers are jealous of when they hear how we work.</description>

      <description>At many organizations I’ve worked at over the last few years, I’ve seen a common anti-pattern: configuration management (CM) tools used incorrectly as provisioning tools. This has been frustrating because using CM tools to provision infrastructure undoubtedly leads to complex code that is unmaintainable and hard to extend.
The purpose of this talk is to show how I’ve seen this unfold and how using tools such as Terraform and CloudFormation significantly reduce this complexity without compromising your reach with infrastructure as code.</description>

Every workplace has its own unique set of things that are awful/failing/suck. But that&amp;rsquo;s ok, most everyone is not running 10k containers in production or has a fully-automated deploy process. Embrace the things you have and iterate improvements.</description>

      <description>Sharing and transparency is one of the core tenets of DevOps. One outgrowth of this principle is a plethora of open source software and tooling, as well as blog posts and conference talks. Despite all of this available information, it can be difficult to understand how to put together the puzzle for a particular infrastructure, which is where reference implementations can provide greater learning and understanding than copy/pasting multiple blogs together.</description>

      <description>Most devopsdays events are a combination of curated talks and self organized conversations. The self organized content is known as “open spaces”. Open Spaces give attendees the opportunity to talk about anything they’d like. A person might suggest a topic they want to learn about, or one they feel like they can help others with. The topics range widely, from highly technical, to pure culture, to board games for networking.</description>

      <description>In DevOps it is common to have Ruby, Python and Bash on all Windows machines - will you install PowerShell on your Mac workstation and Linux servers?
What if PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s platform of origin had not been Windows or if it had not started as a proprietary product? Would you view it differently today?
This talk is about how the architecture of PowerShell puts developer productivity front and center and how that has a direct, practical, positive effect on the individual developer experience as well as team level benefits.</description>

      <description>Most organizations aspire to automate building, deploying, configuring, testing, and managing their software and infrastructure.
But what benefits are we expecting from automation? Will we save money? Reduce our staff? Require less technical knowledge in-house? Achieve faster time to market? Improve reliability?
Some of these expectations may be difficult to achieve. Some may be impossible to achieve.
Let&amp;rsquo;s understand and exploit the true benefits of automation, which allow us to reach digital success and avoid expensive failure.</description>

      <description>Failure Testing prepares us, both socially and technically, for how our systems will behave in the face of failure. By proactively testing, we can find and fix problems before they become crises. At Netflix and Amazon we ran regular Game Days where we would test our system for failures in order to find problems, save us from future incidents, and train our teams how to handle the unexpected.
This talk will walk through the process of how your team can run an effective “Game Day” and safely test your system for weak points, identify opportunities to bake in more resilience, and ensure your team is well-trained.</description>

      <description>Throughout our organizations there are different lenses of understanding. These lenses can cause the exact same picture to be viewed differently by viewers with a different lens. While these lenses provide incredible versatility and perspective to a company, they can become a liability in times where a shared understanding of a problem exists. Nowhere is this more prevalent than in the worlds of Dev and Ops. Together lets walk through the damage that these fragmented visions can cause, how we can repair them and the benefits to be reaped from a shared context.</description>

      <description>So the dumpster is on fire. Again. The site’s down. Your boss’s face is an ever-deepening purple. And you begin debating whether you should join the #incident channel or call an ambulance to deal with his impending stroke.
Fires are never going to stop. We’re human. We miss bugs. Or we fat finger a command — deleting dozens of servers and bringing down S3 in US-EAST-1 for hours — effectively halting the internet.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT The concept of automation is not new. This has been an ongoing progression of achieving efficiency, repeatability, and scalability. What is exciting that has happened in recent years, is the creation of frameworks that allow you to focus on the content in your automation, instead of focusing on creating an automation process itself. We are no longer each doing our own thing in a vacuum with scripts to glue provisioning together.</description>

      <description>DevOps trends are clear on measuring systems Mean Time To Recovery rather than Mean Time Between Failures. I argue that worrying about time between failures actually causes more harm than worrying about recovery. But do we think of our human systems the same way as our digital? I’ll apply lessons learned in SysOps to HumanOps.
I’ll talk about how our complex social systems act like complex computer systems and how focusing on MTTR rather than MTBF is a good thing between people, not just machines.</description>

      <description>One of my first memories from my DevOps journey, was hearing the statement &#34;&#34;DevOps is primarily a mind-set&#34;&#34;. Coming from an Operations focused background, at the time I didn&#39;t fully understand the significance of this statement. Over the past several months, we have been developing a solution to help promote DevOps within our client delivery organisation, while helping to bridge the gap between our Development &amp; Operations teams. By developing an Enterprise focused Continuous Delivery Platform, and offering it as a Service, we aim to standardize the Continuous Delivery pipeline within our organisation.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time at bol.com, the biggest online retailer in the Netherlands, the IT department was split in Operations and Scrum teams. As we grew in size and we moved towards continuous delivery, the necessity for a more DevOps approach arised. We saw that we can benefit to get closer to each other, which resulted in splitting operations into SRTs (Space Reliability Teams) that worked closer to the Scrum teams.</description>

      <description>As student Richard Feynman had an unorthodox approach to mathematics. Later he would frequently stun his famous and well established colleagues — simply by using tools from a different box.
We have very different tools — and methods in Dev &amp;amp; Ops. Much of DevOps has been to transfer methods and tools from Dev to Ops. But coming from Ops, I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that there are things Devs can learn from their Ops colleagues.</description>

      <description>Serverless and AWS Lambda specifically allows developers to build super scalable application components with minimal effort. AWS Kinesis and SQS can be used to create a universal event stream to orchestrate Lambdas into much more complex applications. Now, with AWS Step Functions we can build large distributed applications with Lambdas using visual workflows. In this session you will see how Step Functions are different from Amazon Simple Workflow, how to get started with Step Functions, and how to use them to take your Lambda-based applications to the next level.</description>

      <description>What should you do if your product must be tested on multiple operating systems before delivering? And what if it must be tested on different browsers? Now it is a lot of combinations. And how to do this on a agile way? Here is a talk about how we can orchestrate automated tests on different systems, on different browsers. Assuring the coverage on all operating systems and browsers supported by a product is one of the toughest tasks commonly faced when transitioning to a devops setup.</description>

      <description>A DevOps way of working promises many benefits; from faster delivery to a more stable operating environment. But it’s not all about the technology!
To successfully implement and sustain DevOps, you must look at your people first. Join Jamie as he introduces the key roles that are critical success factors for any DevOps implementation.
Why would this talk be a good fit for the DevOpsDays audience? Introduce a wider IT audience to the career development options that are available for traditional IT Organisations (IT Horses) to practice DevOps.</description>

      <description>Diversity can improve the bottom line of companies and lead to unfettered discoveries and breakthrough innovations. (Katherine W. Phillips, Scientific American, October 1, 2014) Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s great for business, but it&amp;rsquo;s also the right thing to do.
It all started last year at DevOpsDays Tel Aviv, when Leon Adato told me that there were definitely more women in attendance than at DevOpsDays Ohio. I had noticed that, too. What had they been doing?</description>

      <description>Our job as engineers does not stop with eliminating technical defects and ensuring high reliability. Engineers of all kinds must ensure their work serves the public good. A service that reliably harms, exacerbates injustices, or excludes marginalized groups is not a service worth building and maintaining. Learn how to effectively accomplish change in your working conditions or your employer’s products through grassroots employee advocacy, from an employee advocate who has successfully lobbied their employer to change both product policies and working conditions for the better.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s next, now that we&amp;rsquo;ve made applications immutable?
One big gain from containers is not the containers themselves, but that they make us build applications the way we always should have: immutably. Only with immutable infrastructure can we really scale the number of machines per operator, and new container stacks are helping get us there. But other portions of the stack need to be immutable too, starting with the base OS.</description>

      <description>Impostor Syndrome is traditionally seen in high-achieving individuals who have an inability to internalize their accomplishments and merits. They are plagued by fear that a misstep or mistake will expose them as frauds and their house of cards will come crashing down. Traditions aside, I believe all of us have experienced this at some point or on a regular basis and I’d like to discuss possible ways to deal with or overcome it, at least temporarily.</description>

      <description>Get a quick intro to the coding academy for refugees by its founder Christian Hirsig. In Bern and Zürich already over 30 students have graduated. They have found their way back to IT in a 13 week program and all found an internship company. The first ones are already hired and are now independent from social welfare. The IT industry jumped in with mentors and coaches who where allowed to get involved in the program on company time and they were providing the internships.</description>

      <description>With DevOps being a relatively new “movement”, there are few stories of real world .NET development groups in enterprise-size companies successfully adopting Continuous Delivery and DevOps practices. Many .NET teams are discouraged by the lack of support for Windows/.NET or the daunting task of learning a completely new set of tools/languages. They are looking for guidance from those who have been through the trenches and have real world experience.
Our teams have successfully made this transition for 100s of components in 60+ internal business products and routinely have products deploy multiple times per week.</description>

      <description>Hoje um dos principais desafios no tange a ciclo de vida de desenvolvimento de software, além de tempo e custo, é a automação dos testes e a automação do fluxo envolvendo os processos DevOps de Continuous Integration e Continuous Delivery.
E se você soubesse como atuar mirando processos automatizados de testes dentro de CI e CD? O que é mito e o que é realidade?
Boas práticas para tornar automação parte do seu dia a dia como um QA envolvendo ferramentas, processos e cultura DevOps.</description>

      <title>Performance Engineering in the Age of DevOps and Agile</title>

      <description>Performance engineering was fairly straightforward in traditional waterfall projects. You would performance test at the end of the project after development and all functional testing was complete. This approach simply cannot work in the age of DevOps and Agile. Release cycles happen too quickly. Code changes too much. Data preparation takes too long. Results analysis is too slow. You need new approaches. Performance engineering needs a new paradigm. And you need to rethink the role of the performance engineer.</description>

      <description>If you ask ten people to define DevOps, you’ll likely get a dozen different answers. Somehow, it’s 2018 and we still can’t agree on what DevOps is, only what it looks like. Many companies want all the benefits from DevOps without making any changes to their organization. The truth is that successful DevOps implementations require hard work over long periods of time.
DevOps at our company is a survival mechanism. We need to be lean and innovative or we’ll simply not exist as a business.</description>

      <description>Infrastructure as Code has been a native open source innovation happening over the past decade, with languages such as Puppet and Chef growing fast ops folks have been adopting development practices to run their infrastructures. In the mean time the operations people together with the developers ran into the limitations of traditional CI platforms where a lot of “Dirty Clicking” was the norm , creating a pipeline for a stack, or new project was a boring manual experience.</description>

      <description>Applying product management to internal platforms&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; appeared on the ThoughtWorks technology radar late last year, but what does it mean? I was super excited to start as a platform product manager at the beginning of this year because as much as I like product, I love tech more. The past 6 months have been a wild ride, with questions like:
 How can we determine goals for our team? In a consumer organisation, how do we contribute when all the success metrics are end user focussed?</description>

      <description>Docker &amp;ndash; actually containers generally &amp;ndash; has changed the say that software engineers and operations do work. We use them for repeatable builds, for scaling, for our testing architecture, and so much more. Here we focus on using Docker for pluggable, versatile command line tools, focusing on how to exchange data within such a system while letting containerization handle requirements for discrete components.</description>

This talks discusses which category of tools fit where, the characteristics they must meet to keep up with the team&amp;rsquo;s software development pace, and suggests specific open source or free tools you can use to get started. We will also discuss alternatives to breaking to CI build for security.</description>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-amsterdam/program/zane-lackey/</guid>
      <description>The standard approaches for web application security over the last decade and beyond has focused heavily on slow gatekeeping controls like static analysis and dynamic scanning. However, these controls was originally designed in a world of Waterfall development and their heavy weight nature often cause more problems than they solve in today’s world of agile, DevOps, and CI/CD.
This talk will share practical lessons learned at Etsy on the most effective application security techniques in todays increasingly rapid world of application creation and delivery.</description>

      <description>This talk was born, quite surprisingly, out of listening to Carrie Fisher talk about her struggle with addiction. What really resonated with me was when she talked about how she coped with her struggles by talking about them with others.
“It creates community when you talk about private things and you can find other people that have the same things. Otherwise, I don’t know - I felt very lonely with some of the issues that I had or history that I had.</description>

      <description>Great automation doesn’t replace humans; it enhances us. When we are choosing or building tools for our team, we want them to play like team members: keep us informed, make the easy decisions repeatably, and pass the hard decisions to the humans along with the information we need to make them.
Based on research in human-centered design, this talk enumerates principles and challenges of collaboration for programs. It lists strategies for eliminating “human error” as well as human frustration.</description>

      <description>How do I prioritize spending limited cycles on unlimited potential problems?
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a technique stolen from “real world” reliability engineering that allows us to create objectivity within a subjective domain.
By brainstorming a list of all the failure modes of a system and then subjectively ranking and quantifying them, we can generate a relative priority for each case, allowing for clear agreement between teams on which cases (if any) warrant action or automation.</description>

      <description>The feedback loop is one of the most important parts of programming. We write tests and try to mitigate all possible problems, but until we deploy our code, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell what &amp;ldquo;works&amp;rdquo; and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t. In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss methods used to ensure everything works the way it should before deploying to production.</description>

      <description>Problemas permitem que possamos aprender cada vez mais, são eles que permitem que nos desafiemos, resolver um problema é o que realmente nos motiva. Empregos existem, pois existem problemas. Empresas existem porque empresas, governos e pessoas possuem problemas. Problemas são agentes de mudança e aprendizados. Problemas!? Oba!</description>

      <title>Progressive Testing to Meet the Performance Imperative</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-boston/program/paul-bruce/</link>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-boston/program/paul-bruce/</guid>
      <description>Users care as much about how your service performs as they do what job it helps them accomplish. This is the modern performance imperative. So why do we still see so many 503 errors and slow apps? The answer is empathy, a lack thereof. Performance is the most tangible element of “non-functional” quality criteria we regularly ignore until it’s too late. The cloud doesn’t save us magically either. “Building quality in” starts with a mindset guided by technical experience, team alignment, and empathy for your customers.</description>

      <description>The DevOps movement is gradually changing IT organisations. Project managers are often forgotten, but they also need to change. Are project managers ready for the DevOps change?
The wall between Dev and Ops has now broken thanks to DevOps, but there are other walls needed to be broken. One of them is between developers and project managers, making the communication and understanding between them difficult. We need to break this wall as the project manager needs to work alongside the DevOps team in order to help the company to change the old mindset and working together sharing goals and responsibilities.</description>

      <title>Project Triage: What To Do When It All Hits The Fan</title>
      <link>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-minneapolis/program/eryn-oneil/</link>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Hope for the best and plan for the worst.&amp;rdquo; We spend a lot of time talking about best practices: the ways we should run our projects and write our software so that everything turns out as well as possible. But when you add human beings to the mix—whether they’re coworkers, clients, or, well, you and I—something will eventually go wrong.
Using case studies from the interactive agency world (where no two clients are ever the same), we’ll talk about methods for triage, what to do when you sense a project is on shaky ground, and ways to ensure everyone gets to the other side in one piece.</description>

      <description>Operations at Duo, perhaps not surprisingly, are very security focused. However, we can&amp;rsquo;t use our own products to protect our servers because if Duo is down we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to access our systems to get things back up. As a result, we can talk about securing your infrastructure in a way that&amp;rsquo;s guaranteed to not be a vendor pitch!
We&amp;rsquo;ll start out covering how to secure your infrastructure in operations-friendly way with frameworks like threat modeling, prioritizing infinite security backlogs, and compensating controls.</description>

      <description>Choosing appropriate tooling for the provisioning of virtual infrastructure such as servers, storage, and networking components is a challenge due to the variety of available tools. These tools range from provider-native services such as AWS CloudFormation to multi-provider technologies such as Hashicorp&amp;rsquo;s Terraform. Between the native and non-native solutions is a family of light-weight tools that operate directly on provider-native template files. I will briefly review the trade-offs between the different types of tooling, discuss why we chose the CloudFormation template-generating library SparkleFormation to meet our specific goals, and conclude with a tour of our SparkleFormation implementation.</description>

      <description>Aplicar alterações em produção nos projetos tradicionais e ter a confiança que tudo esteja funcionando como esperado sempre foi um desafio.No mundo DevOps, gerar feedbacks e tomar decisões em cima deles, pode ser uma solução para ajudar os testes. O que essas mudanças significam? Como fazer isso?
Nos projetos tradicionais, testar em produção significa um grande desafio, pois é a garantia que todas as suas alterações estão funcionando como esperado no ambiente final.</description>

      <description>Have you ever been in a meeting and had a question you didn&amp;rsquo;t know if it was okay to ask? I mean, nobody else is asking the question, so you assume you should know&amp;hellip; and the meeting silently marches on.
Those moments reflect how safe someone feels in their group to take a risk. That question could have opened tremendous insight (or failure), if only it were asked. In this ignite talk we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at the single most significant contributor to team effectiveness: psychological safety, and the role it plays within DevOps-enabled organizations.</description>

      <title>Psychology of Estimation: Faster is not always better</title>

      <description>In 1979, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky coined the term “Planning Fallacy” to describe plans and forecasts that are unrealistically close to best-case scenarios. These plans can be improved by consulting the statistics of similar cases.
When you look at the software development and projects done using Agile methodologies, you can see the same phenomena. Projects are estimated too optimistically at start. We are usually too focused on best-case scenarios. Although our experience shows that statistically projects are done closer to their worst-case scenario, we stay optimistic.</description>

      <description>Measuring the quality of tests is a hard problem. Code coverage metrics don&amp;rsquo;t tell us if a feature is actually being exercised in tests. Failure histories are lost if (sorry, when) Jenkins goes down. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get a comprehensive overview of which tests ever tell us our code is broken. How do we know which tests are providing value? And which aren&amp;rsquo;t? How do we collect data about escaped and regressed bugs, or determine which tests are using the most resources?</description>

      <description>Although QAs and DevOps can be seen as two different roles, the truth is that they have more things in common than we think.
When we are creating the structure of our test suites, we need to take into account some practices and tools DevOps normally use in their daily work. From integrating the test automation with the CI tool to catching bugs as soon as possible to the use of containers to speed up test executions.</description>

      <description>Workshop Many DevOps devotees have heard about security and maybe even read a few blog posts about DevSecOps. But you get busy building code, reducing WIP, and eliminating tech debt. That doesn’t leave a lot of time to make sure the code you are actually deploying is secure. But the power of DevOps is that you can build security in once, and it’s there. And even better, you don’t have to be a security expert to be able to start deploying more secure code.</description>

      <description>What is time? Is it fixed or fluid; physical or philosophical; quantifiable, or completely questionable? These deep questions may never be answered, but one thing is clear: the measuring, recording, and interpretation of time is a fundamentally important mission for humanity. In the modern age of computing, the accurate reckoning of time across cities, countries, and even planets is performed by a fantastic patchwork of actors - from governments and corporations, to academicians and hackers of all colours.</description>

Mentoring and sharing your knowledge and experiences will enhance the &amp;ldquo;Read, Write, Speak, Teach&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; aspects of software development. Seeing mentorship as mutually benefical for the organization, senior devs, and junior devs alike, we start to understand it as a long-term solution to tech&amp;rsquo;s ongoing hiring needs.</description>

      <description>Microservices is an increasingly popular approach to building cloud-native applications. Dozens of new technologies that streamline adopting microservices development such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Envoy have been released over the past few years. But how do you actually use these technologies together to develop, deploy, and run microservices?
In this presentation, we’ll cover the nuances of deploying containerized applications on Kubernetes, including creating a Kubernetes manifest, debugging and logging, and how to build an automated continuous deployment pipeline.</description>

Jan de Vries translates this book towards DevOps, as he did before with Taleb’s book Antifragile. It explains why some concepts work and others don’t. It’s like turning on the light in your DevOps environment. And it helps you to improve your (IT) organisation in the right direction.</description>

      <description>Complex mixes of monoliths, micro-services, databases, data centers, networking, and cloud providers provide a dizzying array of opportunities for your services to fail. No one has perfect failover, so you have be prepared to play defense.
We will look at three categories of failures and ways to recognize them coming, and avoid spreading the carnage they cause to other services you provide.
 Zombies: Long running but abandoned requests that eat up memory and crash the system long after the user who conjured it gave up.</description>

      <description>“Why did we decide this?” – every developer in history, 12 months after making a decision.
As technologists, we make architectural decisions all of the time. What we’re not good at doing is:
 Socializing these decisions though the team/department (whoever participated in the discussion has the context, everyone else is out of luck!) Recording the decisions, and more importantly, the context behind the decisions, in a way that our future selves (or anyone – someone just joining the team, for example) can look back and understand why the decision was made and what the factors that went into the decision were.</description>

      <description>&#34;I have a strategy to solve the DevOps transitional challenge. It is called reducing inertia that can be seen on daily basis in finances, team behavior and tech stacks. Reducing the friction in these areas is key to successfully move to the DevOps way of work. For me, ‘inertia’ is a good way of making value flow visible and I’ve been using it as the principle underlying my work. This approach can be applied especially successfully in more complex environments, such as enterprises.</description>

Registration is full. Try our waitinglist. Due to high demand, we&#39;ve sold out of tickets for the event. We&#39;ve reached room capacity and can not make exceptions. There is a waiting list. Recordings of the talks will be posted on Youtube approximately 3 weeks after the event. We may not be able to accommodate all waitlist requests due to space limitations, but anyone on the waitlist will receive early notification when registration opens for the next DevOpsDays-NYC.</description>

      <description>As a team practicing DevOps for Xfinity Mobile, we are always looking for opportunities to increase the velocity in which we move software through the deployment pipeline. This becomes increasingly important as we begin to discover production issues which are impacting our customers and require immediate attention.
A common side-effect of increasing speed is a reduction in quality. We MUST avoid this as much as possible. Through automating processes which are good candidates for automation, we can actually increase both speed and quality at the same time.</description>

      <description>I started Jellyvision&amp;rsquo;s release management program in 2016 and helped teams go from 50 releases in 2016 to 300 in 2017, while reducing the rollback rate from 8% to 4%. We went from multi-day, morale-plummeting deploys to checklist-driven deploys with lots of structure, which paved the way for CICD in a few ways, but also held that progress back.
I&amp;rsquo;ll talk through the practical steps we took to continue evolving to CICD while making the best of the structure that Release Management provides.</description>

      <description>The days of trying to prevent failures are gone. In today’s high-volume, cloud-based systems, anything that can go wrong will eventually go wrong. It is far better to spend our time engineering fault tolerance than pursuing the impossible goal of fault prevention. Not only is reliability engineering one of the highest paying jobs in software engineering today, it is also a job full of unique challenges that demand creative thinking and problem solving.</description>

      <description>Control your service reliability, don&amp;rsquo;t let it control you. Who runs services in production? Who knows their service availability? Don&amp;rsquo;t be a victim of reliability theater. We will discuss how service reliability impacts your business and how to manage, and understand risk. We will also discuss how to communicate the important concepts of risk and availability with stakeholders. With recommendations from SRE, learn how you can take control of your services reliability.</description>

      <description>Around eighteen months ago Findmypast started a complete re-architecture of our products and core to that is our adoption of continuous deployment and trunk based development. In order to achieve that we heavily adopted what we&amp;rsquo;ve coined repository driven development (RDD). What is repository driven development I hear you ask? It&amp;rsquo;s where you configure all remote systems that your codebase connects to from within the codebase itself. Monitoring, Alerting, Logging, Consumer Driven Contracts, Dashboards, testing and deployment, container requirements.</description>

      <description>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed associations between human genetic variants and hundreds of human traits, including disease susceptibility. We found that differences in quality control (QC) upstream of GWAS critically affect the results. Despite this, no clear mechanism for reproducibility of GWAS QC pipelines exists to our knowledge. We developed CLINK, a cloud-based interactive GWAS QC tool focused on reproducibility. We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) machine images, adopting a dev/ops model to develop a version-controlled virtual appliance geared around the Jupyter Notebook.</description>

      <description>Whether you manage a single application with thousands of identical nodes or a collection of unique, single-purpose servers, reproducibility of your infrastructure is critical to testing, rel iability, and disaster recovery. Every DevOps tool purports to solve this problem, but too often, it feels like your &amp;ldquo;automation&amp;rdquo; involves more checklists than code, and this struggle only ge ts worse when you try to combine multiple tools. Turns out, though, you actually can make the dream of reproducible infrastructure a reality.</description>

      <description>Raw engineering talent is important to achieve business and product needs; however, it is also important to make space to improvement team dynamics in order to maximize the effectiveness of individuals and maintain emotionally healthy working environments. One tactic to achieve this is to organize team retros on a regular cadence.
Retros, when executed properly, empower individuals to give and receive blameless honest feedback. Done wrong or not at all, resentment can build and lead to a toxic engineering culture.</description>

Integração/Entrega contínua (CI/CD), arquitetura microserviços, testes automatizados, Cloud e Infraestrutura como código são práticas e tecnologias que realmente funcionam e estão presentes em empresas bem posicionadas no mercado. Entretanto, é conhecido que adotar tais práticas e tecnologias em ambientes com legado é um enorme desafio.
Apesar disso, engenheiros DevOps têm concentrado esforços na adaptação e desenvolvimento de técnicas, ferramentas e práticas que auxiliem organizações que possuem legado em suas jornadas de transformação.</description>

The communication structures are heavily influenced by how the teams are structured and whether they can create a culture of shared responsibility.
In this presentation, Adarsh Shah will talk about various team structures and how DevOps culture prospers in those structures. He will explain when and why these team structures can be beneficial and what are the various paths that he has seen organizations take during the DevOps transformation journey from Dev &amp;amp; Ops silo to one of these team structures &amp;amp; their pros &amp;amp; cons.</description>

      <description>DevOps is about culture and mindset more than about technology - but how do you measure success? How do you know if your company really &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;does&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; DevOps?
It turns out that root access to production servers is not only the proverbial holy grail but actually serves as a fact-based measure for the trust and automation levels in an organization.
This talk explores the connection between root access and automation on one hand and DevOps mindsets, cross functional teams and shared responsibility on the other hand.</description>

      <description>TALK DESCRIPTION We built a dashboard that aggregates feeds from various security-specific tools in our DevSecOps Tool Chain. The result was an eye opener on the effect of organizational culture and individual behavior on the application security posture. The Developer Dashboard collects data from tools such static code analysis, dynamic app-scan, open source scan, JIRA, source code repository/version control, LMS (training), LDAP, and others. The data is visualized to help identifying root cause for repeated introduction of vulnerable code or poor quality code as related to effort that includes the adoption of secure coding practices, management endorsement of the secure-by-design mentality, availability or lack of proper training, legacy apps with dead or obsolete code, or applications with no active development or support.</description>

      <description>How do you build a $1B product when time and resources are scarce? Intercom’s Rich Archbold says the solution is to do more with less, a strategy he calls “Run Less Software.” Our capacity as engineers is limited, and no one wants to spend their time on arbitrary tools that aren’t core to the business. Rich will tell you how your teams can utilize the run less software philosophy to optimise for speed, simplicity and total cost of ownership.</description>

      <description>When we’re responsible for production, it can be hard to find room to learn. That’s why I run my own email server. It’s still “production” — if it stays down, that’s pretty bad — but I own all the decisions, take more risks, and have learned lots. And so can you! Come see why and how to get started.
With one command, install famously secure email software. A couple more and it’s running.</description>

      <description>Running a marathon is not an easy task. Participants can spend months preparing for it and need the right motivation and goals to succeed. Transitioning to a DevOps culture and related process can also feel like running a marathon. It will require long term plans, iterating on those plans and the commitment to keep trying, as there will be bumps along the road.
Often DevOps is thought of limited to tools such as Splunk, Zabbix and Jenkins used for production monitoring, continuous integration and continuous deployment.</description>

Why are you taking this thing we care about? How else can we know if there are connectivity issues to RabbitMQ? How else can we know if the consumer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough capacity? What does queue length tell us - and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t it tell us?</description>

      <description>As Ben Treynor (VP of 24x7 at Google and founding father of SRE) puts it, &amp;ldquo;SRE, fundamentally, it’s what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations function&amp;rdquo;. What does differentiate an SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) from DevOps? Aren&amp;rsquo;t they the same?
SRE is a job function that focuses on the reliability and maintainability of systems. It is also a mindset and a set of engineering practices to run better production services.</description>

      <description>Hillary for America was the organization created for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. By election day, the campaign employed 82 software developers. A team of four SREs and two Security Engineers helped protect and scale close to a hundred backend services against a constant stream of DDoS, looming deadlines, and constantly shifting priorities.
This team helped build an environment for rapidly launching new projects, raising billions of dollars from donors, and withstanding spiky and semi-unpredictable traffic.</description>

      <description>No matter how you define it, the Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) role is clearly expanding into more and more companies. To be effective in this new role, SREs must possess a depth of understanding of how different systems work together, how they fail, how they can be improved, and how they can best be designed and monitored.
Here are the steps you&amp;rsquo;ll need to gain acceptance and maximize your effectiveness, whether you’re still figuring out how to create a site reliability practice at your company or you’re trying to improve the processes and habits of an existing SRE team.</description>

      <description>Just within the last ten years (+-3), we have seen at least two separate communities evolve from the generic idea of Systems Administration/Operations. The first, DevOps, grew up very much in public, the second happened more within the halls of “special” companies like Google and Facebook and is only now starting to gain visibility and traction in the wider world. They have a number of priorities in common but also diverge in some very interesting ways.</description>

You will learn about stateful Kubernetes components and how we use them to run small and large scale production clusters.
Elasticsearch is a scalable text-search engine that replicates its index onto many instances. Managing many clusters can be daunting as their configuration drifts and their intrinsic data distribution diverges.</description>

      <description>So you’ve done it. Your team of developers has finally gotten hooked on CI/CD pipelines. Last week you had a few and all of the sudden it seems like you could use a pipeline for everything. Whether you use Jenkins, TeamCity, or open source solutions like GoCD, there are certain growing pains that come with increasing the number of pipelines and CI/CD servers to support your team(s). While some pains are common to most infrastructure, others are more unique this specific tool; after all it is a service that quickly becomes a developer’s lifeline for pushing code.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT Scaling a DevOps transformation is one of the biggest problems enterprises faces as they seek to accelerate value delivery. Some teams focus on the culture and automation changes in silos or with limited collaboration. Other teams may not understand the value and continue to deliver at a cadence they have always found comfortable. Tool fragmentation, process fragmentation, misunderstandings of how CI works or what CD actually is are constant struggles.</description>

      <description>Scaling systems is hard, but we’re developers — that’s kind of our thing. Scaling people? Well, that’s significantly harder. Humans are complicated.
Broadly speaking, companies have three stages of development: infancy, those awkward teenage years and — if they survive the trials of adolescence — adulthood. An infant startup is so drastically different from its adult incarnation that they can be considered different companies. Each will have a unique mission and culture.</description>

      <description>Many organizations have found great value in retrospective analysis following incidents that impact the reliability and availability of a service. Known as postmortems, companies routinely analyze what went wrong in retrospect.
However, common approaches to postmortems are often short-sighted in their focus and rarely bring about any real improvements to our overall systems. Commonly viewed as a required exercise to cover your butt or to provide a report to management, most focus solely on root cause and suggested fixes.</description>

      <description>Config management tools have revolutionized how machines are managed, making it easy to keep your estate in infrastructure-as-code form. People can write code to modify your estate, and that can be treated in the same way as your regular code: CI, code review, and have unit and acceptance testing.
Seems great right? However, IaC is not a free lunch: having all your infrastructure information in one place can lead to some uncomfortable security pitfalls: There’s potentially a lot of sensitive information in there, such as SSH keys, API tokens and passwords.</description>

      <description>Secrets are pervasive in modern systems and managing them across an organization is a complex task. How you store your passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information is just the beginning. Those secrets have a complex life-cycle of access, creation, revocation, and audit history that needs to be controlled. HashiCorp Vault is an open source tool that aims to address those issues. It provides a unified interface to secrets in your organization along with access control and audit logs.</description>

      <description>Imagine secrets management that is seamless to use by developers, easy to deploy and maintain for operations, and reduces risk for security. In this hands on demo, learn how CyberArk Conjur Open Source can help abstract secrets management from developers while providing strong machine identity, authorization, and authentication that doesn’t disrupt flow or velocity. Even if secrets management is not your problem, it could become your problem if someone else decides to use a solution that disrupts your workflow.</description>

      <description>As developers we need to build secure software, but can&amp;rsquo;t possibly know everything about security. Secure-by-design is a guiding principle for building software. By tackling security issues when designing the application security is no longer an afterthought after the project has been completed. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn how good design drives security by using patterns, mindsets, and best practices for real world development. We&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss how to find and address flaws in existing code and.</description>

      <description>The advance toward more managed and abstracted Cloud Native deployments is reducing the ability to provide security in the traditional way. Controls of hosts, networks and administrators are no longer relevant. So what is left? See how to provide security and compliance in these deployments.
While many organizations are still in the early stages of deploying containers in production, the technology continues to evolve. Recent introductions such as AWS Fargate, Microsoft ACI and serverless approaches like AWS Lambda are now reaching the market, bringing both an opportunity for more flexible deployment and a need for updated security models.</description>

      <description>In a fast moving DevOps world it is all about enabling teams to move faster. Autonomy is key to get to a higher pace of innovation. But… Does autonomy mean that everybody can do everything? Even on production? Definitely not, but how do you balance between autonomy and restictions. When it comes to security and permissions this is a hard topic. How do you (or the security officer) keep track if everything is compliant?</description>

      <description>Digital security can be a really intimidating topic when you&amp;rsquo;re new, and even when you have some experience it still seems like more effort than it&amp;rsquo;s worth. As devs we often have most of the company keys on our laptops all the time because we sometimes need them, but advice on securing them is nonexistent, bad, or overly cumbersome. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk a bit about threat modelling to aid in making informed security decisions, and then mention some tooling that makes protecting your secrets easier to do.</description>

      <description>Everyone agrees that security is important, but in reality it&amp;rsquo;s often a tickybox at the end. And by the time someone is thinking about security, many individual decisions have been made along the way that make security much more difficult than it has to be.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the basics: all applications have vulnerabilities (known or not), so we want to sandbox them to limit the attack surface. Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t this happen in all cases?</description>

      <description>In a DevOps world everyone performs security work, whether they like it or not. With a ratio of 100/10/1 for Development, Operations, and Security, it’s impossible for the security team alone to get it all done. We must build security into each of “the three ways”; automating and/or improving efficiency of all security activities, speeding up feedback loops for security related activities, and providing continuous learning opportunities in relation to security.</description>

      <description>A lot of security people have a bad attitude about DevOps. Heck, sometimes it’s for good reasons. Lots of vendors are selling “DevOps in a box”, they’ll come in and “do the DevOps for you”, etc. What can you end up with? Lots of people with root access to servers with real data on them, code being deployed straight into production without appropriate testing, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria!</description>

      <description>DevOps principles are great, but when introduced into a legacy development process, this change can be tough. However when working on projects with tight timelines or trying to catch up to a rapidly advancing market, it&amp;rsquo;s important that these processes are put in place. It&amp;rsquo;s important that everyone is on the same page with these changes, and for non-technical team members, it can be difficult to quantify the benefits of DevOps culture.</description>

      <description>As infrastructure increases in complexity and monitoring increases in granularity, engineering teams can be notified about each and every hiccup in each and every server, container, or process. In this talk, I’ll be discussing how we can stay in tune with our systems without tuning out.
The ability to monitor infrastructure has been exploding with new tools on the market and new integrations, so the tools can speak to one another, leading to even more tools, and to a hypothetically very loud monitoring environment with various members of the engineering team finding themselves muting channels, individual alerts, or even alert sources so they can focus long enough to complete other tasks.</description>

      <description>Increasingly complex architecture generates a lot of noise, which in turn causes a catch-22: we need monitoring systems that generate appropriate levels of noise based on incident severity. In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing sanity saving steps that teams can use to design lean monitoring systems.
Integrations have been key in helping teams signal each other about all kinds of valuable information: when code is ready for review, when features are ready for release, when resources are running low or there is an outage, or even when the team is getting ready to go to a team lunch.</description>

      <description>Google App Engine is a very powerful but also a mostly unknown service featuring a serverless design. It allowed me to run my php-based website: www.url.rw, that generated more than 12 million page views in July 2018 with zero downtime and scaled perfectly / seamlessly up &amp;amp; down according to my traffic needs. Total costs for that month: 10USD. In this talk I will give a quick introduction on what Google App Engine is, what problems it can (+not) solve and my fight with scaling EC2 hence my love for serverless architecture/design!</description>

      <description>With the rise of serverless architecture, many of the common day-to-day operations tasks will change dramatically, if not disappear completely. We as Operations professionals will be challenged to redefine our roles and responsibilities within the technology organization as serverless abstracts away the server and its respective OS to cloud service providers. No stranger to this scenario, we will not only be tasked with solving these engineering obstacles introduced by the new serverless paradigm, but we will also need to prove our value to the business in the face of a changing technology landscape… again.</description>

      <description>Serverless is a big trend now, as a new way to go beyond your own infrastructure relying on someone&amp;rsquo;s PaaS instead. Most of the solutions people usually know are proprietary FaaS solutions provided by the major cloud providers.
But what would you do if you&amp;rsquo;d like to experiment, having your own servers or even data centers without exposing your customers&amp;rsquo; data in the cloud?
You can experiment with FaaS solutions built upon either Apache Mesos or Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>This talk summaries the SRE way of managing services, by which we define the goodness of a service as needed by the business and then use the bad time we can have to perform changes and increase the velocity of the service development. The talk will cover concepts from the Service Level Indicators (SLI) definition and how to make them universally accessible and useful with graphs and alerts to how to define how good a service should be.</description>

      <description>Modern application architectures are embracing public clouds, microservices, and container schedulers like Kubernetes and Nomad. These bring complex service-to-service communication patterns, increased scale, dynamic IP addresses, ephemeral infrastructure, and higher failure rates. These changes require a new approach for service discovery, configuration, and segmentation. Service discovery enables services to find and communicate with each other. Service configuration allows us to dynamically configure applications at runtime. Service segmentations lets us secure our microservices architectures by limiting access.</description>

      <description>Modern application architectures are embracing public clouds, microservices, and container schedulers like Kubernetes and Nomad. Public clouds bring dynamic IP addresses, ephemeral infrastructure, and higher failure rates. Microservices increase the number of services running and have more complex service-to-service communication patterns. Schedulers run multiple services per machine, and dynamically schedule and move workloads.
These changes require a new approach for service discovery, how services find and communicate with each other, as well as how we secure our microservices architectures by segmenting access.</description>

      <description>Service Virtualization is a recognized technique for improving the SDLC from development to testing in several ways including reducing costs of development, enhancing the flexibility of the testing environment, and overall reduction for the services time to market. While these benefits are discussed often, it can still be unclear how an organization can start utilizing Service Virtualization to suite their specific needs.
In this session I will discuss how organizations can navigate the nuances of service virtualization starting from the decision to incorporate it into the SDLC to executing the technique successfully across multiple different teams.</description>

      <description>Companies adopting microservices are recognizing the importance of the service mesh: a transparent layer that adds application-level resilience, observability, and security to your infrastructure. In this talk, we’ll talk about what a service mesh, why you might need it, and how it works. We’ll show a service mesh in action, using the open source Envoy, Istio, and Ambassador projects running on Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>The shift to microservices is a ticking timebomb of complexity. Decomposing a monolithic app into hundreds of microservices comes with a new set of challenges that become readily apparent when running in production. Enter a new category of tooling: the service mesh. There&amp;rsquo;s been a recent surge of interest in the so-called &amp;ldquo;service mesh&amp;rdquo;, but what is it? Why is this suddenly relevant now? Why would you even need one? If you&amp;rsquo;re considering running microservices in production, this talk is relevant to you.</description>

      <description>The Docker slogan &#39;Build, Ship, and Run&#39; advertises easy set up of immutable software builds, but it is not always that easy. Setting up immutable builds with Docker is pretty straight forward and shipping is just a matter of pushing the image to a repository. The next step is building the cloud infrastructure to run the containers. In this talk I briefly touch upon building immutable software. But the main focus of the talk will be on creating an immutable infrastructure.</description>

      <description>While the use of configuration management tools, like Chef or Ansible, have taken off, it seems as though many engineers still manually test their Infrastructure code.
Adding automation to your testing process greatly improves the reliability of your infrastructure code, reduces the chances that mistakes are made, and even improves time to deploy.
We will be creating and testing a simple Puppet module using the Puppet Development Kit/RSpec/Docker and adding that to a Gitlab Pipeline.</description>

For enterprises, learning is an investment which involves, infrastructure, material, setup and effort.
We created an Ansible Training Lab to train a huge workforce using Ansible &amp;amp; Docker.
From bootstrapping a machine to setup of the complete lab takes ~ 1 minute. The lab is scalable on the fly, leverages the idempotency feature of Ansible as its best. Every student has his/her own sandbox and extreme LEAN Infra usage.</description>

      <description>A pragmatic test-driven approach to the problem of inheriting legacy code, based on real-life high-stakes projects. While it would be nice to test everything from the ground up, this only happens in fairy tales. In real life, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to invest your testing effort where it counts the most.
We propose a pragmatic test-driven approach to the problem of inheriting unstable legacy code, based on real-life high-stakes projects. We will cover automated and manual testing with limited resources, but also strategies to build a culture of reliability, accountability and pride within a development team.</description>

      <description>We all live in an ever changing industry, and we are used to expecting and adapting to change. However it proves challenging when our job shifts to become something else. Eight months ago, our engineering team underwent a major development. Those that were previously QA are now developers within their respective teams, and all developers now share responsibility for producing quality code. The team has shifted from having a dedicated QA team to having developers owning the quality of their code, so the entire team is now responsible for developing and testing code.</description>

      <description>Microservices are hard. Distributed systems are harder. Knowing customers are facing issues before they call your support team seems nearly impossible. What&#39;s worse is these failures can persist for long periods of times while all conventional patterns of testing indicate things are O.K. Detecting these failures early is mission critical.
What started as no monitoring at all changed to &#34;that bash script engineer X wrote&#34; all the way to a system of containers routinely checking system health has been a journey spanning half a decade.</description>

      <description>High availability is becoming a de-facto requirement of today&amp;rsquo;s applications. Customer-facing IT failures mean directly losing customer revenue and trust, as users have grown accustomed to easily switching service providers for more reliable ones. Lack of internal systems availability block employee productivity and add to the financial burden. Thus, it is critical to have a healthy, performant, resilient IT structure serving as a backbone of conducting your business. But there are no textbook solutions to achieving five 9s availability.</description>

      <description>With the proliferation of DevOps toolchains, access to an evidence based holistic view of the end to end software delivery lifecycle is challenging. Without integrated correlation of data between existing tools, visibility and traceability of software delivery is inhibited. This leads to delays in feature delivery and Production instability. A &#39;Single Pane View&#39; provides a real-time intuitive visual feedback mechanism of the complete delivery lifecycle. This is achieved by harvesting data from within each element of a DevOps toolchain.</description>

      <description>Is site reliability engineering and serverless a match made in heaven or a disaster waiting to happen? In this talk we will discuss just what is this serverless thing anyway, why it maters and what it means for building reliable systems. We will also explore each of the SRE principals such as embracing risk, service level objectives, monitoring and others and map them to their serverless counterparts to identify challenges and best practices.</description>

      <description>In January 2016 Activision approved a pilot project to build a containerised continuous delivery pipeline using Docker. This project spanned multiple devops teams and would culminate in launching a production title &amp;ldquo;Skylanders Imaginators&amp;rdquo; in October 2016.
This talk will discuss the cultural and technical challenges faced throughout the pilot. Spoiler alert: Not everyone was happy with the decision to use Docker. The talk will cover the concerns and how we handled them.</description>

      <description>Software security is one of the areas in the software development which are less looked into. With the increasing cyber attacks, it is essential to safegaurd our applications and reduce the vulnerabilities. Security should be considered throughout the development life cycle and should be an integral part of DevOps.

      <description>Ok, now that I have your attention let me explain what I mean. Imagine you could build a fully converged (compute, network and storage) multiple component container based service from one source controlled YAML file. Also included in that definition you could add complex deployment policies such as placement, replicas, scaling and restart constraints as defined with that single source controlled YAML file. Then imagine you can defines a specific JEOS Just Enough Operating System (JEOS) operating system definition for that same service that is also defined from a single source controlled YAML file.</description>

All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time there was a little travel start-up based in Edinburgh called Skyscanner. It was a lucky start-up as it became successful and grew and grew and grew. But as this start-up got bigger things that worked stopped working and this made the start-up sad. The architecture of its platforms wouldn&amp;rsquo;t scale for example; but that is another story. One thing the start-up didn&amp;rsquo;t want was to leave start-up land behind.</description>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-kansas-city/program/cullen-mcdermott/</guid>
      <description>Test Driven Development (TDD) is a practice that helps to design software by writing the requirements as tests before any real &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; has been written. It has historically been limited to software development. However, with the rise of infrastructure as code (IaC) in the past few years, this practice is starting to be used for infrastructure automation as well. Changes can be made with confidence by making sure tests continue to pass and by addressing edge cases as they are encountered by adding new tests.</description>

      <description>Technical diving involves working with systems that interact in complicated ways in a high pressure environment where failures are unavoidable but also highly dangerous. This talk uses the framework of technical SCUBA and rebreather diving to talk about patterns for failure management and how they can be applied in an engineering context. It examines the ways that complex systems fail and challenges our heroism-based model of success which ignores consistent, uneventful execution.</description>

      <description>DevOps talks tend to emphasize SLDC and CI/CD situations. In this talk I teach 5 of the most important DevOps principles (Small Batches, MVP, and The Three Ways of DevOps) by applying those principles outside of the usual web application environment. Case studies improving a new-hire onboarding process, improving a website failover process, deploying a monitoring system, building a PXE-install system, and writing a book. By the end of this talk you&amp;rsquo;ll have a better understanding of the principles of DevOps in a way that helps you apply them at home and at work.</description>

      <description>This talk describes the journey of building a brand new, platform-first, microservices architecture at Box. Building a new architectural stack presents a bunch of challenges with design choices, technology selection, and balancing simplicity with richness of feature offerings. A ‘steel thread’ to designing architectures helps identify the critical components of the stack and then gradually roll out incremental features - all while the engine is still running. The challenges really snowball when you on-board live traffic with high scale, high throughput and low latency requirements.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT Everyone loves Serverless, but what if I told you that you that’s there’s a tool out there that can take it to the next level? AWS Step Functions combine logic and Lambdas into complex state machines that take automation to the next level. In this talk we will cover the basics of Step Functions, a Lambda design pattern that emphasizes code re-use, and some examples of what you can do with Step Functions.</description>

      <description>The IT industry is moving in a fast pace. We may be doing software development comfortably for the last 10 years but to keep ourselves relevant and stay employed, we need to move out of our comfort zone and learn new things. This session will focus on the latest trend of the DevOps movement as well as some soft skills that a developer should have to make ourselves marketable and/or stay employed.</description>

      <description>TALK ABSTRACT Karith brings her wit, wisdom and humor to two of the hottest people topics in DevOps: Interpersonal Communication and Imposter Syndrome.
Primary to breaking down silos in organizations is breaking down barriers between people who look at the world in very different ways. Karith breaks us out of the traditional view of diversity and inclusion by offering a truly inclusive perspective on communication, learning, and creating an environment vital to organizational success.</description>

      <description>With sustainable growth a huge challenge, many tech companies are exploring the option of remote offices or workers in order to acquire the tech talent they need. Some tech companies are even comprised entirely of remote tech staff.
However, working remotely to the main thrust of operations can prove to be a frustrating experience all round with communication and cooperation ending up severely impaired.
This talk unveils lessons learned from being one of just a dozen folks working nearly 5000 miles away from 2000 centrally based tech staff.</description>

      <description>At some point, we all find ourselves at a SQL prompt making edits to the production database. We know it&amp;rsquo;s a bad practice, and we always intend to put in place safer infrastructure before we need to do it again, but what does a better system actually look like?
This talk progresses through 5 strategies for teams using a Python stack to do SQL writes against a database, to achieve increasing safety and auditability:</description>

      <description>When building digital products in startup environments, it is critical to ensure we are focused on the right tasks to maximize the impact of our efforts. During a recent engagement, I failed to convince key stakeholders that they were asking for too much too soon. The company eventually failed when we ran out of runway, and a key contributor to this was that we strayed from a lean, MVP-focused, mindset. Let’s discuss how engineers and developers can deliver technical solutions while being mindful of the businesses needs.</description>

      <description>Although many people think so, DevOps is not only about tooling nor continuous integration. But what is it about and what makes DevOps a success and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t ? Implementing DevOps successfully yields far beyond tooling and processes and also includes agile culture, application architecture and organisational changes among others. Frank will give some insights into what European companies do in this space and explain about the building blocks that make up the value add of a successful DevOps implementation.</description>

      <description>Tight deadlines and an extraordinarily complex mission critical project needed help and fast. Recognizing at the inception of the project that the only way to successfully get through this project was to automate as much repetitive workload as humanly possible. We needed our project team focused on building new capabilities for our customer and not getting bogged down with what would normally be a very time consuming task. The deliverable was a preconfigured virtual machine that was going to need to be built, tested and scanned many times over during the development cycle.</description>

      <description>I will tell my story, Post-Maternity Blues in DevOps, the challenges I have faced and workarounds done for the last 4.5 years, so that I can still enjoy my family life, thrive with my passion and also remained sane. I will share the challenges I’ve been through, pre-interview stage, during the interview, and after getting the job. From flexible working hours to night time support calls, bank holiday on site deployments… And I will talk about tips, such as: taking “No” as a default answer to be the starting point for the negotiations, not a final answer; bonus system we had with my husband so that I can go to evening meet-ups [he collects bonuses to use later]; and 3 weekly recurring grocery/3 monthly supermarket delivery schedules.</description>

      <description>Many presentations on Microservices offer a high-level view; rarely does one hear what it’s like to work in such an environment. Individual services are somewhat trivial to develop, but now you suddenly have countless others to track. You’ll become obsessed over how they communicate. You’ll have to start referring to the whole thing as “the Platform”. You will have to take on some considerable DevOps work and start learning about deployment pipelines, metrics, and logging.</description>

You have to deliver a new service that talks to vendors around the world, and you know we’re using AWS now, but you’re not sure what a secure network looks like, and you’ve only got a week to get it live, so you leave it open for now and hope you’ll get to go back around and fix it when you’ve got time.</description>

      <description>In a world of increasingly faster software releases, our production environments are no longer static for a couple of weeks between deploys, they’re an ever-evolving, moving target. In this environment, accurate and informative monitoring is paramount. However can traditional monitoring practices fully provide this? We need to know exactly what our users are experiencing, as soon as possible, not merely machine-level metrics. As a solution, I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the concept of Synthetic Monitoring; simulating user behaviour to provide monitoring ABSTRACT alerting.</description>

This presentation will cover tactics for these three pillars that my team is implementing to promote change for a 15 year old business service, including:</description>

That person is so productive!” This is leads us to hold back on using lighthearted things in our work life, which is a shame. In this talk, I’ll hit 4 of the ways I’ve found to use fun stuff for serious business.</description>

      <description>SPOILERS
 As long as you&amp;rsquo;re actually accomplishing stuff, people just plain like working with fun folks (this is the easy one)
 Embedding fun links incentivizes readers to read everything (or form-filler-out-ers to fill out your survey)
 Saying &amp;ldquo;Please&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Thank you&amp;rdquo; with cute animals gets you better support service
 Blowing bubbles engages your parasympathetic nervous system (the anti-fight-or-flight response)!

      <description>The increasing significance of our systems, the increasing potential for economic, political, and human damage when they don&amp;rsquo;t work properly, and the proliferation of dependencies and associated uncertainty should give us all concern. If we look at our own system and its problems, I think you many will agree that we need to do more than acknowledge this &amp;ndash; we need to embrace it. What does it mean, then, to take human performance seriously in software?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to share a workshop with you, using the Three Ways of DevOps to inspire creative, innovative thinking. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t just work for people in Dev or Ops but also managers, test professionals, support teams and people from other business areas.
The workshops begin with a short talk about the Three Ways, assigning a personality to each one: “Gods”, “Investigative Reporters” and “Geniuses”. Participants then choose the personality or way that most interests them.</description>

      <description>One of the best, and also worst, parts of organizing a conference is selecting the talks. You likely receive submissions on an order of magnitude greater than the speaking slots you have. And most of them are super great! How do you pick the ones that tell the story you want?
In this talk, I’ll explain how the methods used by “mockumentary” filmmakers like Christopher Guest (Best in Show, Waiting For Guffman) can be used to help “find” the story in your talk submissions.</description>

      <description>Hootsuite was one of the early adopters of Terraform and faced some challenges early on with Terraform workflow. * This session will cover how Hootsuite uses Terraform modules and leverages them to bridge the gap between devs and operations. * We will discuss how we came up with our own state management system that helps us safely mutate the state of our infrastructure from one state to the other. How you can organize your Terraform states across multiple tiers of your infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Your team started using Kanban boards and visualizing your work a while back and, though everyone is happy about the increased visibility, your team is nowhere near the utopia other teams say they’ve achieved. Even worse, you don’t know why or how to get there!
Many teams hit this same plateau and stop, falling tragically short of the value that can be achieved with deeper Kanban implementations. Julia Wester will share tangible steps to take to help transform shallow kanban implementations into systems focused on flow and continuous improvement.</description>

      <description>I work at a call center that offers IT support. If you’ve talked to me, you probably don’t like me. However, if you know what to expect when you call, the chances of you both getting your computer fixed and you being happier in general are much higher.
This is a talk that sets out the general support process when calling to request technical support for your personal electronics. Many customers who need a repair for a personal computer either don’t understand this process or haven’t prepared for technical problems that would cause them to call.</description>

      <description>Adapted from his class “The Screaming Horrors of Git,” Corey takes us on a magical tour through the (mis)use of Git to do things its creators never intended. In this humorously delivered exploration of one of the open source community’s more ubiquitous tools, Corey demonstrates that a finely crafted wrench makes a barely acceptable hammer if you hold it wrong.
Given that most modern toolsets are backstopped by git repositories (or, if you’re unfortunate, Subversion), git is increasingly central to DevOps tooling and design patterns.</description>

In this talk, come explore the design patterns that work well with Lambda, through a discussion of what failure looks like.
This talk starts off with a quick introduction to what AWS Lambda is and where it came from. From there, we transition into demonstrating the absolutely worst possible ways in which to use it– along with what make these simple mistakes terrible ideas at scale.</description>

      <description>Continuous testing is one of the most effective ways of building quality into the software delivery pipeline. Although effective test automation throughout the delivery pipeline is a must, continuous testing requires the entire team to be responsible for quality as well as new approaches to testing.
In this presentation, you’ll learn how to implement an effective continuous test strategy. We’ll look at examples of what works and what doesn’t. You’ll learn how to optimize test scope and test cases to create effective test automation.</description>

      <description>What does “uptime” really mean for your system? An end-to-end (e2e) check is where the rubber hits the road for your user experience and is the operator’s best tool for measuring uptime as experienced by your users. Creating and evolving e2e checks also establishes a basis for defining the SLOs and SLIs that we are willing to support.
We&amp;rsquo;ll explore what it means for a system to be “up” by talking about what makes a good end-to-end (e2e) check and what techniques are valuable to pair with them.</description>

      <description>Have you ever felt like you &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; be writing tests for your code, but not really known where to start? Have you looked for testing resources and been swamped by tens of subtly different test-driven development tutorials? Do you feel vague guilt about not following &amp;ldquo;best practices,&amp;rdquo; but not enough to get over the hump and figure out how to get started?
This talk will fill in some of the gaps between &amp;ldquo;draw a circle&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;draw the rest of the owl&amp;rdquo; and show you a more effective way to get started with automated testing.</description>

      <description>Much of the organizational problems come from an unexpected place: The Erie Railroad company in the 1850’s. Since this first org-chart, we have sliced our businesses along functional roles. And since those roles vary from slice-to-slice, each slice is evaluated based on different measurements. This is fine, right up until two slices have a relationship in which their measurements - their incentives - conflict.
In this talk, the audience will learn the source of this conflict, why the typical org-chart is causing more problems than it’s solving, how Product Teams help prevent code from becoming “Legacy”, and ensure that software is created sustainably.</description>

      <description>I read the recently released Accelerate: State of DevOps 2018: Strategies for a New Economy report and was intrigued to see that respondents with cloud implementations that met the five essential characteristics of cloud, as defined by NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology), were an astonishing 23 times more likely to be in their group of elite performers (a subset of their high performers who are achieving the highest levels of both speed and stability) than in the lower performing groups.</description>

      <description>The benefits of shift-left quality testing included reduced schedule risk, higher confidence and reduced costs. Would shifting security left see the same benefits? With recent changes in the speed and accuracy of the tools, absolutely! Let’s talk about how to make shift happen in your SDLC.</description>

      <description>When my team chooses to run infrastructure on AWS, the breadth of services enables rapid prototyping and the elasticity of the cloud enables immense scale. This flexibility comes at a cost, reflected in the complex, sometimes opaque, bill we receive at the end of the month. Deciphering the bill is joint effort between data science, engineering, and finance. Using the bill to understand our usage requires a data warehouse and enough SQL to power 1000 homes in Seattle.</description>

      <description>No distributed system is safe from failures, and neither is your organisation. Is it possible to extend the CAP theorem to people and gain a Consistent, Available, and Partition Tolerant workforce in the face of disparate levels of leadership, anachronisms, and a million priorities ?
This talk will cover some of the ways you can enable your organisation to ensure that flying into the face of danger shall not cause you fear.</description>

      <description>The data is very sensitive for the bank, and therefore banks have very high standards of the cyber security. However, there are still a lot of challenge to promote DevSecOps culture.
Since 2018, we starts to integrate Cyber Security into DevOps culture by running DevSecOps program. We aim to shift left the Cyber security mindset to the development teams through promoting DevSecOps tools combined with the relevant trainings.
In this presentation, we will share how to integrate DevSecOps tools, such as Checkmarx, Contrast and Sonatype IQ into development CICD pipeline to produce vulnerability reports through cyber security testing and scanning source code and 3rd party libraries.</description>

      <description>As one of the largest banks in the world, we have run a few years DevOps program in HSBC Technology to establish DevOps culture and mindset between teams. Recently, DevSecOps starts to become more and more popular, especially for banking industry, which is very sensitive on data and therefore has a very high standard for the cyber security. However, there are still a lot of challenge to promote DevSecOps culture, especially in a large bank.</description>

Sure you can set incentives, you can reorganize and adopt SCRUM, but rarely does one achieve a devops culture through business led &amp;ldquo;digital transformation&amp;rdquo;. Paul will talk about the concrete steps that you as a leader, or you as a practitioner can utilize Automation, Measurement, and Sharing within a Lean framework and move the needle and drive towards a DevOps culture by doing the work and proving value.</description>

      <description>How do you become a high performing technology organization? Over the past four years, the State of DevOps Report has shown how high-performing IT teams decisively outperform low-performing peers. The report has also investigated the effects of burnout, culture and employee engagement on organizational performance. Nicole Forsgren shares insights into the key leadership, technical, architectural, and product capabilities that drive these outcomes. She offers highlights uncovered over the last four years from the 23,000+ responses.</description>

When I think of complicated fictitious projects none is more complicated than the Death Star from Star Wars. Not only was it a weapon with the capability of destroying an entire planet from quite some distance away but it was also a moon sized city.</description>

He will share their experiences including what type of Enterprise Architecture is actually needed, tactics for transitioning and when it&#39;s best to just kill off Enterprise Architecture and let the DevOps cowboys run wild.
Beyond the microservices gordian knot nonsense
Current application theory says that all responsibility for software should be pushed down to the actual DevOps-style team writing, delivering, and running the software.</description>

      <description>This year two of our Enterprise DevOps journey. The big question we came back to was &amp;ldquo;how do we scale this&amp;rdquo;? This led to a bit of a history lesson on how we got here. As a bank that has roots that go back over 190 years and has been thru many acquisitions, we have compiled a lot of complexity. This drove us to distributed organizational model to support the systems and not the business or customers.</description>

      <description>For as long as I’ve been in IT we’ve always broken up our initiatives into people, process and tools to understand their impact on an organization. Historically though, we’ve had a Taylor-istic view of ‘people’ and tend to really think of them as a set of skills. If the new process and tools required new skills we’d ask ourselves if we needed to train the existing folks or hire new one, probably a little of both.</description>

      <description>Over the past 7 years of the DevOps movement, there has been a healthy tension between behavior, speed, and resilience. Empirical and analytical evidence suggests that when these three are in equilibria the outcomes create organizational performance. With behavior being an anchor of organizational performance. In DevSecOps, the motivation is to embed security patterns and practices into existing DevOps capabilities thereby creating similar equilibria with increased organizational performance. In this session we are going to observe the IT security practices over the past 10 years that one might suggest having had a metaphorically “felonious” narrative based on the resultant outcomes.</description>

      <description>This talk is for people who want to know how Elasticsearch works, and where it can be used.
I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about &amp;ldquo;What is Elasticsearch&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;How/Where use Elasticsearch&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Because Elasticsearch is a engine near-real-time&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s a shard, index, segments&amp;rdquo;. ;)</description>

      <description>Everybody wants to go to heaven, but none of them want to die. Is there some way we can have the devops and not change anything? Is there some way we can buy the devops and rub it all over everything?
We know there must be a better way but often can&amp;rsquo;t change. Devops initiatives become an intractable collection of compromises between the past and the future. Some focus on the tools, some focus on the people, most focus on what seems most comfortable to them.</description>

      <description>Traditional Operations isn’t going away, it’s just retooling. The move from on-premise to cloud means Ops, in the classical sense, is largely being outsourced to cloud providers. What’s left is a thin but crucial slice between cloud providers and the products built by development teams, encompassing infrastructure and deployment automation, configuration management, log management, and monitoring and instrumentation—all through the lens of self-service.
Join me as I share my vision for the future of Operations as an organizational competency and how it relates to DevOps.</description>

      <description>Whenever visiting Edinburgh you should definitely go Greyfriar´s Kirkyard and read the stories told on all those old tombstones.
Taking a look at the &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;graveyard&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; of DevOps where all unsuccessful attempts to adopt this modern apporach are buried, we will discover that all of them have also stories to tell. These are stories about why they failed – stories we all could learn from. We will discover that a lot of stories will be about bad habits and behavior, about ego and the fear of losing power, about good ideas with bad approaches – about us, the humans!</description>

Turns out, there are really three different, but interrelated, types of instrumentation, each suited to answering different questions, and supported by different software.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Costs of Chasing the Mythical &#39;Five Nines&#39;</title>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Five Nines&amp;rsquo; refers to the five nines in 99.999% available that is often synonymous with highly available. Does every highly available service require five nines? Not by a long shot. Yet the general state of the practice is to chase after this typically unrealistic goal almost blindly in many cases, often leading to unnecessarily high costs in both operational and development resources. Even less aggressive availability goals are often over-specified compared to true business drivers.</description>

      <description>Abstract If you do not have an Error Budget, chances are you are wasting resources chasing a mythical SLA that has no defined business driver.
Site Reliability Engineering practices and tooling can reclaim much of these costs and resources, but only after there is organizational awareness that they exist.

      <description>“Organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations”
— Melvin Conway, 1967
Microservices is an architectural shift, a huge topic that demands change in every aspect of software delivery. It is also more than a technical problem — your microservices architecture can be as solid and efficient as your team communication. In fact, microservices is not an architectural choice at all.</description>

      <description>The load balancer is often used to stitch the various software components that make up your application into a coherent whole, addressing concerns that spread seamlessly to cover both development and operations, and thus being a critical part of the system as a whole, and a fundamental element of your availability and scaling.
At deltaDNA we have used HAProxy over the past few years to manage both our high volume client APIs as they built past 10k hits/s as well as our web applications.</description>

      <description>We all know “that person”. The “one” that’s more than willing to correct you, publicly or otherwise, with information that is so pure, and 100% unequivocally factually correct. You’ve might have met this person at a Meetup during a social mixer, at a conference, or you encounter them in your everyday work. You might have even dabbled in such behavior in your youth. Maybe in college when you were eagerly filling your head with so much information, you had to just let people see how smart you are.</description>

      <description>From time to time, communities will run across information security incidents. In the course of project expansion, it always seems like a good idea to wake up a new instance of Something_With_A_Database and not write down the credentials or think very clearly about what the permissions are on that new instance. If you&amp;rsquo;re involved in open source for any length of time, you&amp;rsquo;re going to discover a hack at some point in time.</description>

      <description>After tenure of a year or two at many companies, a senior engineer’s access level is often maxed out. He or she probably has full root permissions across the entire infrastructure. We call these privileges ‘master keys’ and, just like a building’s master key, they are very dangerous if they fall into the wrong hands.
Instead, privileged access should only be granted on a temporary basis. Sometimes this means requesting increased access from a manager, or a peer.</description>

      <description>In almost every software project, in almost any company, some aspects of the software are neglected: logs are crappy, metrics are badly designed, backups are hard, customer support tooling is an afterthought. Have you ever seen &amp;ldquo;logging&amp;rdquo; in the feature list? or &amp;ldquo;deprecation&amp;rdquo; for that matter? As almost every software service needs these, why are they often overlooked? Why are some requirements not defined as features? It turns out that when we design our products we ignore certain categories of users, and their use cases are ignored until very late in the life of the product; these are “The missing user stories” The talk will present various user stories, such as &amp;ldquo;As a Developer I would like to search logs so that I can debug a user transaction&amp;rdquo; and expand on what is needed to support that story.</description>

I’ll then show an example of the success Innersource has had at Verizon through our Kubernetes journey and MyVerizon, the mobile app millions of customers rely on to manage their Verizon services.</description>

      <description>Have you ever tried to follow an Agile methodology exactly by the book? I’ve yet to find anyone who has succeeded doing that. Yet we still find people sticking dogmatically to their chosen discipline. Are you tired of looking for that one perfect methodology? Are you more interesting in what an idea can offer than where it came from? Alistair Cockburn’s Oath of Non-Allegiance might be for you. It states: I promise not to exclude from consideration any idea based on its source, but to consider ideas across schools and heritages in order to find the ones that best suit the current situation.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered what happens when you have a high traffic site, rapid organisation growth, significant technology change, a desire to reduce product lead time and improve availability occurring all at the same time?
Is it chaos? Is it plane sailing? Or is it heavy seas?
At Skyscanner is has been all of these at different points over the last couple of years as we pivoted to open-source based development, migrated to AWS, embraced &amp;lsquo;You build, you run it&amp;rsquo;, got serious about data and adopted a Spotify inspired tribes and squads organisation model.</description>

      <description>Workshop DevOps is a growing movement for shortening development and deployment and integrating Development and Operations. This requires a mindset shift, new behaviours and a cultural shift in both Development and Operations.
Business are demanding ever shorter release cycles for new applications. ‘Operations’ is traditionally seen as a barrier with lengthy bureaucratic controls and delays in deploying new releases to production. DevOps is a growing movement for shortening development and deployment and integrating Development and Operations.</description>

      <description>The simulation game is based upon ‘The Phoenix Project’ Book. Parts Unlimited is in trouble. Newspaper reports reveal the poor financial performance of the organization. The only way forward to not only save the company but to make it competitive and profitable is “The Phoenix Project” which represents an IT enabled business transformation, with Retail Operations as the business owner of this project. The VP of IT Operations is asked to take the lead of the IT department and ensure that “The Phoenix Project” will be a success.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been said many times - technology moves fast. As do the philosophies behind it. This isn&amp;rsquo;t new - the Pony Express lasted only 18 months before being replaced by telegraph. Why is turnover so fast? What are the benefits and pitfalls to this turnover? Where is the value in what we do?</description>

      <description>As DevOps continues to move to the norm, it becomes even more important for teams to have effective communication and collaboration. With intentional networking, teams become more familiar and integrated with each other which leads to less painful (and costly) communication in the process.
Throughout my career I have witnessed how beneficial networking can be. From landing a new (and perfect) job, to gaining the insight needed to make that slight tweak to a team/process/strategy to catapult to success.</description>

      <description>Consider a legacy application, no tests, manual releases and low velocity.
Learn how to replace a legacy application with a modern service-oriented architecture and build a continuous deployment pipeline. I’ll discuss the process, automated testing, monitoring and trunk based development.
It&#39;s a situation many of us are familiar with: a large legacy, monolithic application, limited or no tests, slow &amp; manual release process, low velocity, no confidence... A lot of refactoring is required, but management keeps pushing for new features.</description>

      <description>Every software team writes code, but some teams produce fewer bugs than others. Every software team creates new features, but some teams develop features users love and others don’t. What do high performance teams do differently, and why are team members more focused, satisfied and relaxed? They truly work together. No 10x rockstar programmer can achieve what a well rounded, enthusiastic team can.
Sven examines how the best software teams set and follow goals, integrate new members fast, ensure diversity, monitor and continually improve team health, embrace transparency, use a playbook to guide them through every phase of development and much more.</description>

      <description>How do you become a high performing technology organization? Over the past four years, the State of DevOps Report has shown how high-performing IT teams decisively outperform low-performing peers. The report has also investigated the effects of burnout, culture and employee engagement on organizational performance. Nicole Forsgren shares insights into the key leadership, technical, architectural, and product capabilities that drive these outcomes. She offers highlights uncovered over the last four years from the 23,000+ responses.</description>

      <description>In Science, progress follows a path from tool development, leading to data, then on to theory. In software as well as science we have seen long periods of normal science and puzzle solving, and disruptive paradigm shifts.
In Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari describes the cognitive revolution as &amp;ldquo;The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago&amp;rdquo;.
This talk will provide a new view of the DevOps movement, through the lens of scientific and cognitive revolutions.</description>

      <description>Some of the most interesting stories come from the career paths of software testers. What did you do before you started testing? Everyone has a before. Everyone has a moment they can point to when they realized quality assurance was something they might enjoy, and that it was an actual job. Then, came test automation.
Automation divided the discipline into distinct groups: pro-manual, pro-automation, and bored.
How can exploratory testing re-ignite a discipline and pave the way for more to choose testing as a career path?</description>

The topic for &amp;lsquo;DevOpsDays&amp;rsquo; is &amp;lsquo;Everything as code&amp;rsquo;. You can&amp;rsquo;t get more &amp;lsquo;everything&amp;rsquo; than the universe! In this presentation I&amp;rsquo;m going to step away from containers, orchestration and servers to talk about what programming can teach us about maths, science and philosophy. This presentation probably isn&amp;rsquo;t going to help you build or manage systems, but it should excite and interest those who are curious about the big questions!</description>

      <description>Over the past 3 years, Visma has worked systematically to radically improve how we develop, deliver and operate our cloud services. Our work has centered around creating, continuously improving, and adopting a &amp;ldquo;Visma Cloud Delivery Model&amp;rdquo; which is based on the principles of Continuous Delivery, DevOps and the use of public cloud.
By onboarding 40 teams to this model, we have gone from working in a fairly siloed way to having autonomous teams with much broader responsibilities.</description>

      <description>Berkley Packet Filters (BPF) started out as the language used for writing filters for BSD, most commonly used these days for filtering packets in tcpdump.
In the last 10 years, the Linux kernel has got a bunch of functionality which makes monitoring performance at the kernel level easier and more efficient, which means we can write our own tracers for metrics we&amp;rsquo;d usually try use strace to get, and other useful metrics.</description>

We talk about our computers like they are humans. We give them names. We talk to them. We refer to them as having human characteristics. “My computer is sleeping.” “My phone is dying.”
At the same time, we are dehumanizing people.</description>

      <description>Cloudflare operates a large distributed network: we have more than 150 data centres across 75 countries. We recently decided to integrate a second CPU architecture into our infrastructure. The obvious choice was ARM64. Apart from doing the basic hardware bring up we also needed to port all our software stack to ARM64, which includes a lot of in-house and third-party open-source components. Turns out, even if the software is written in a cross-platform architecture-agnostic language, there are a lot of potential ways it can fail on a different architecture.</description>

So you’ve implemented you DevOps processes, you’ve agreed on the technology you’re going to use to deliver, but here is the killer question&amp;hellip;. how are you going to attract and retain the people to implement the vision?
DevOps is all about culture, but one of the most difficult areas in the implementation of DevOps practices is finding exceptional people with the relevant skill sets who can put the strategy created into practice.</description>

      <description>The human impact of on-call operations work should not be underestimated. As slaves to the pager we have lived through years of relentless stress, disturbed sleep and disrupted lives. That needs to end.
As our businesses become more reliant on technology, the platforms we support become more complex. We simply cannot anticipate every problem that might occur and we shouldn’t try to. In this talk we’ll explore the real use cases for machine learning in infrastructure operations and SRE.</description>

      <description>Restaurants deliver delicious food while we deliver amazing products to our customers. How can DevOps evolve to deliver software to customers faster than ever before? We&amp;rsquo;ll take cues from the past, the present, and look to the future of DevOps while drawing inspiration from the restaurant industry.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start by going over the history of DevOps culture with a jump to the past in the 90s all the way into today.</description>

      <description>We all manage to define and use technical metrics that focus on velocity and quality in a DevOps environment. http://devopsflowmetrics.org is a good example.
But what about organisational and cultural metrics? There is no clear and consistent set. While these are at least as important as the technical ones, realising that almost every DevOps implementation is slowed down because of organisational issues.
This workshop is about putting together a working set of organisational criteria, split into leading and lagging indicators.</description>

      <description>When a datacenter goes offline, a server gets overloaded, or a binary hits a crashing bug, we usually have a contingency plan. We reduce damage, redirect traffic, page someone, drop low-priority requests, follow documented procedures. But why do many failures still come as a surprise? In this talk, we look at some real life analogs to preventing and managing software failures. Fire partitions. Public safety campaigns. Smoke alarms. Sprinkler systems. Doors that say &amp;ldquo;This is not an exit&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In 2016, companies spent over $25 billion on public cloud services. And almost a quarter of that spend was wasted on idle or unnecessary resources. That&amp;rsquo;s upwards of $6 billion (with a &amp;lsquo;B&amp;rsquo;) in money washed down the drain. And chances are, you are on of the people who could trim the overhead on your cloud spend. There are numerous studies and research done to identify the areas for improvement, but if you boil it down to the basics, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that there may be a single primary reason for all the cloud overhead.</description>

And you might have joined in the innovation councils/teams/Hackathon/Lab to contribute, only to realize that we brainstorm forever and even if ideas do get generated, there is no Business hunger for it. This is because your super boss has assigned 33% of the KPI to your boss for Innovation.</description>

Over the past 8 years, the DevOps movement was the stimulant to create a large number of new tools, lots of them open source, some not.</description>

      <description>Modern cloud applications today are built as distributed microservices. These microservices talk to each other over L7 protocols: HTTP, gRPC, Redis, Kafka, and more. In this world, L7 proxies have assumed a crucial role in managing and observing L7 protocols. In this talk, I’ll discuss the evolution of service architectures, the role L7 proxies play in this world, and how there is now a battle raging between Envoy Proxy, HAProxy, and NGINX.</description>

      <description>GDPR: Acronym for the “General Data Protection Regulation” law applicable since last May 25th
Every single one of us received a rain of emails from websites we sometimes didn’t even remember we had ever signed up to, asking us to check our privacy settings or letting us know that there were changes in the privacy policy. Most of us probably developed #GDPRFatigue. It’s ironical how a norm that is intended to protect our privacy originated such a terrible spam wave!</description>

      <description>Developers and security have often been at odds. Developers want fast and more frequent releases; security wants more security. DevOps can introduce security earlier in the development cycle, meet key compliance requirements, AND provide a faster time to market while making applications more secure.</description>

      <description>The investment in technological infrastructure represents a vital asset of the company for the continuity of the business. Keeping applications and services available 24x7 represents a challenge because of the complexity and growth of them. Complex IT environments, third-party applications, and parallel application development create an environment that is difficult to monitor. The use of metrics to monitor development infrastructure seems to be a good bet to help organizations improve the application programming, cost estimation, software quality, and risk mitigation as they grow or change infrastructure.</description>

      <description>In this talk, you will hear about the DevOps journey in our company (Glass, Lewis &amp;amp; Co.), from the initial brown-field all-manual state to our current partially automated situation and the strategic destination of a fully automated and monitored process.
In an equilibrium between a high-level view and useful practical tips, we will touch on what informed our decisions, in terms of priorities and technologies, some lessons learned in setting up Infrastructure-as-Code using Terraform for Azure, and how the legacy constraints helped or hindered us on this journey.</description>

      <description>What went wrong? Why does this always happen? How can we ensure it Never Happens Again? For most of the internet age, engineering teams have focused on finding a cause of an outage. A belief existed, and persists, that all errors or behaviors can be traced back to a single causal entity. The Root Cause Analysis is conducted in service of finding that entity, and correcting it. By doing so, we have been taught, we prevent recurrence of the error in question.</description>

      <description>Billions of edge computing devices have now been deployed in the so-called Internet of Things. And the combination of massive IoT data and machine learning promises to transform traditional industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and agriculture.
But there is a gap between the lofty promises and the dark side of that transformation. Personal data is funneled into barely-understood machine learning models used to deny health insurance or manipulate elections. Embedded systems engineers are working with yesterday&amp;rsquo;s threat models as often as yesterday&amp;rsquo;s build tools.</description>

      <description>Great software testing relies on more than technical acumen. Testers must be curious and flexible in their approach to testing. With the entire Devops team responsible for quality, dedicated testers may not be the only teammates testing your team&amp;rsquo;s software. This requires a mindset shift for anyone moving between developing and testing.
In addition to that mindset shift, teams often face other challenges to great testing. Testing is sometimes seen as a dirty job.</description>

Many use Docker in their CI pipelines; but few everyday users are aware of the security issues surrounding the docker socket on docker hosts and the complications this brings. I want to highlight one such issue with the docker socket when creating docker containers within docker containers.</description>

The primary benefits included reduced schedule risk, higher team confidence and reduced development costs. Additionally, developers have gotten better at writing functional code and fewer things are found late in the cycle. What if we tried the same with security? Would we see the same benefits? Absolutely! Let’s talk about how to make shift happen in your SDLC.</description>

      <description>What&#39;s all the fuss with serverless architecture? To some, it is the future of architecture implementation and is disrupting DevOps, traditional implementation models, enterprise approaches to IT, and entry to and time to market.
This talk is an experience report on how our team fell into a serverless implementation without any real experience of the technology and how we learned about it along the way. I will give a brief overview of what serverless is and its benefits and how we went from sceptics of it initially to advocates along our journey of discovery.</description>

      <description>At Coinbase, we maintain a high standard for security and operational readiness. In line with this, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on having a better way to have a regular process for major updates, while still allowing us to do tightly controlled incremental updates to be reactive for critical updates. This has been implemented as a toolkit we call Minion, which allows us to define a base operating system derived from Gentoo and CoreOS.</description>

      <description>We all love DevOps talks about automated deployments. However, for every other type of operations work, ticket-driven request queues have quietly become the default way of working. Need something done? Open a ticket. Someone needs you to do something? A ticket shows up in your queue.
But what if we made a mistake letting ticket queues take over operations? What if these ticket queues are actually the source of much of the dysfunction, bottlenecks, and capacity issues that have traditionally plagued our organizations?</description>

      <description>It sounds simple to say that we will build one feature at a time, give it an API interface and allow it to connect with other features and microservices. The implementation is anything but simple. This talk explores how you can start migrating your existing features and services to a more modular, testable, and resilient system.
Since containers are not state-aware, how do you make changes to their presentation without needing to rebuild them entirely?</description>

      <description>Have you ever been pressed in your career about whether you want to go into management or be technical? I get asked this a lot. My answer is always, “why do I have to choose?” I’ll like to dive into the root of this question and then cover ways in which you can be a leader and still be a technical contributor. It’s a challenge, but certainly possible. I’ll draw on my experience over the last five years at Puppet, Inc.</description>

      <description>Everyone Pull Requests (or Merge Requests), right?! Actually, no! Some folks just haven&amp;rsquo;t had an opportunity to try PRs. Let’s explores a few good reasons - including a few you&amp;rsquo;ve likely never considered - for trying Pull Requests or upping your existing Pull Request foo.
While many of us assume everyone must be using Pull Requests in 2018, it&amp;rsquo;s just not true. Common examples of people that have never tried PRs are new developers, those transitioning from more traditional operations to DevOps, and those on the fringes of DevSecOps who might not traditionally write a lot of code (product, qa, etc) but do so occasionally.</description>

      <description>Tooth-to-tail is a ratio used by the U.S. Military to quantify the amount of support personnel, called the tail, needed to support a soldier, called the tooth. The ratio is a general indicator of military strength in relation to amount of support and logistics required to maintain that strength. The goal is to reduce the support needed to the lowest point while maintaining combat effectiveness through the use of technology and automation in the tail.</description>

      <description>Practices of trunk based development and continuous deployment have helped our six vertical slice product delivery teams be able to work together on a single product (and codebase) while maintaining rapid iteration and experimentation. With this talk I hope to inspire more teams to try these practices.</description>

      <description>As developers we&amp;rsquo;re part of a mesh of decisions large and small that impact the world around us. All of us have a set of tools that we use to address problems which is built on our experience. As we act together with others our collection of tools grows as do the expectations on us and those around us.</description>

      <description>In DevOps we talk about a cultural change. We aim to tear down silos and create small cross-functional, autonomous and empowered teams. So why not let management do the next big re-org thing: &amp;ldquo;the DevOps re-org&amp;rdquo; and all is going to be fine, right!? No, because DevOps is about people. And to really change a company&amp;rsquo;s culture, we need to change the way people interact together, we need to establish, recreate and foster trust.</description>

      <description>It is around 16:00 on a Friday afternoon and somebody from the other end of the office says out loud: “Who is working on fixing the API tests?” A silence, as thick as a morning fog, covers the entire floor. Nobody has done anything. Slowly, all eyes are turn towards the tester. How could she allow this to happen? When the API tests fail, the deployment pipeline is broken. When the pipeline is broken, there can be no deployment to production.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the year of the service mesh. The promise of decoupling network and security services from the infrastructure, introducing automation, and enabling quick delivery of network services in scalable environments. Should you care about it? Is it too complex to implement? In this workshop we will go through a complete service mesh installation and application delivery through a set of repeatable steps. Using the Istio service mesh as a base we will deploy a multi-availability zone service mesh and demonstrate the power of the security, observability, and traffic management benefits.</description>

      <description>There were significant changes in the Jenkins project over last year. It is still one of the most popular automation servers in the world, but it is not just a “server” anymore. In 2019 Jenkins is a universal automation engine, which actively evolves towards the new Cloud Native architecture and which can be used in any CI/CD flows. It can be used not only as a server, but also as a “serverless” single-shot execution.</description>

      <description>“If a microservice falls down in the middle of a server farm, does my pager make a sound?”
If your service is automatically monitored, then the answer is “yes!”. But now that you’ve been paged and roused from your slumber… what happens next? Do you stumble to your computer, bleary-eyed, trying to find the elusive problem by cross-referencing dashboards and server logs across eleven different browser tabs? Or do you have better tools that you can use to integrate your monitoring data?</description>

      <description>Is it possible to implement DevOps style best practices in organizations best described as an eight hundred pound gorilla (read: very large enterprise)? Some say no, but we at Sourced Group have been doing exactly that for the past 8 years and we’ve lived to tell a few tales about our experiences.
In this talk we will be going over some of the challenges that we’ve faced in the last couple years, and how we solved those problems using advanced cloud native patterns.</description>

      <description>If you were a carpenter, would your skills at building be more important than the tools you use to build? Skills, right? Tools are just a means to an end. So why do developers think the language they use defines the problems they solve?
This talk will take a look at misconceptions across the board, some experiences, both positive and negative, people have had crossing barriers to new languages, and show some of the benefits thinking of one&amp;rsquo;s self as a coder and not a &amp;ldquo;Ruby coder&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;PHP dev&amp;rdquo; can have on being a better problem solver.</description>

      <description>Do your developers think infrastructure is irrelevant to their app? This talk will show you how you can use your infrastructure to write a health check component to make your application more robust.
Most developers don’t really care about the underlying infrastructure on which their app is running. In particular, app developers care that the systems are up and that they provide the appropriate compute/storage/networking capabilities, but rarely do app devs think: “What features of the infrastructure will help me write more resilient and fault-tolerant applications?</description>

      <description>In the world of Agile and DevOps we use many figures, charts and diagrams to argue and reason about our world and how we prioritize and make choices. You can&amp;rsquo;t say Agile without having drawn at least a few quadrants with axes scaling from &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; or from &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;could have been better&amp;rdquo;.
Unfortunately many of these important visualizations are misunderstood at best and abused at worst. We go through coming figures and check our cognitive biases.</description>

      <description>It can be said that early civilization is a direct result of the adoption of the simple, reusable, and highly adaptable stone technology used by our Paleolithic ancestors. A common platform (stone) and easily shared skills (knapping) empowered early humans to create all the tools necessary to survive and indeed flourish. Hunting, fishing, butchering, shelter, clothing, and early agricultural techniques were all made possible by the simple act of banging a few rocks together in a clever way.</description>

      <description>Since the earliest times, human societies have been defined by their tools. Similarly, engineering teams are defined, empowered and constrained by the tool choices we make. In this talk, we’ll see how choosing common tools reduce cognitive load, enable reuse, and foster resilience in DevOps teams.

      <description>Xero originally had a single operations team that that managed all production incidents. As Xero has grown, it has been necessary to empower product teams to support their own services. To do this, Xero’s Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team has developed a set of best practices around incident management. The challenge was to make it easy for other teams to adopt these practices, which is where Xero’s incident management chat-bot was born.</description>

To that end, I’ve spent a lot of time building pipelines in various CI tools. Something that’s become a common tool in my kit is using Docker containers to build the various projects in our pipelines. This has a lot of very interesting benefits, but also comes with a few challenges.</description>

      <description>All commits in a git repository are chained, but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that they cannot be spoofed, edited, or quietly deleted. Using cryptographic signatures with all git tags and commits helps ensure that your repository remains immune to malicious tampering.
Your code is your reputation as a developer. It is also, by extension, the reputation of your project, your team, and your company. Git is a great tool for distributed development, but it is not an immutable ledger of commits in the same way blockchains are.</description>

      <description>Prometheus is a powerful metrics collection and alerting system, and Grafana is a powerful graphing and dashboarding application (which comes with the capability of Alerts on its own as well). While there is a vibrant community around both tools providing both exporters and many Dashboards to help get one started, for a given use case there is likely some work that is needed to be done to customize things further. This may range from needing to update an aging dashboard by renaming variables to match what is offered in a current version of the software than from when the Dashboard was made, to changing or defining thresholds on charts and alerts to match your system or constraints, all the way to desiring to instrument your applications with custom metrics and custom charts.</description>

      <description>WORKSHOP ABSTRACT Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great to add and remove containers from a cluster without having to write or update complex yml scripts? Rancher can help your team manage running containers with less strain. Once you have Rancher up and running and your nodes set up, you can easily add containers, scale your running containers and redeploy containers, all from an interactive dashboard interface.
Rancher can help your team feel more empowered and in control of changing cloud environments.</description>

      <description>100% uptime for a service is unrealistic, with the cost of marginal improvements becoming exponentially costly. This talk will highlight how Google Cloud uses SLOs and Error Budgets to provide uptime guarantees for our external customers, while also being able to aggressively launch new products/features and remain cost competitive at scale.
Google SRE uses the notion of a Service Level Objective (SLO) to define how fast/reliable/available a service needs to be.</description>

      <description>We believe that in today’s fast moving world, it’s more important than ever that infrastructure and software changes are repeatable and can be done with confidence. To support a scalable platform for applications, teams must be able to make changes quickly and reliably. This isn’t limited to applications, but potentially even more important for infrastructure changes that historically have had a less formal testing process. To ensure this, teams must both keep their code and infrastructure definitions in source control, use a pipeline for deployment, and have tests to validate their changes.</description>

      <description>Over the years, I have been involved in several decisions about tooling. While «it’s all about culture» is a common saying, I’m a firm believer that not only do the tools you choose form your company culture, but your culture should also be a part of the decision when you choose your toolset. That is: just because one company is successfully using a particular tool, it will not necessarily work well in your environment.</description>

      <description>A 16 year old inspired me to learn to code.
This lit the fuse that would take me on an amazing journey through challenges and victories while creating an app to help victims escape domestic violence and abuse.
This is the story of how someone with no coding experience got their app approved for the app store.
There were challenges along the way which were far outweighed by the success, impact and achievements.</description>

      <description>VMware is everywhere. But most people think it&amp;rsquo;s just ESXi and maybe vCenter on top of it. Watching this talk will give you a quick understanding of how the VMware ecosystem has grown. Along with the growth, multiple rebranding and name changes has caused confusion. If you&amp;rsquo;re boss is thinking about purchasing vRA/vRO/NSX/vCAC/vSAN/vCAir for half of your IT budget and you don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is, this talk aims to give you clarity here.</description>

      <description>As an organization with 25 production environments and over 6,000 containerized applications we have a lot of secrets to manage. Enough to run 12 geographically distributed HA Vault deployments across multiple cloud providers. Even though the Open Source community provides us with some really awesome tooling, managing that many Vault environments can be tricky.
This talk is about how we manage all those Vault servers and some of the unexpected bumps we’ve hit along the road to stability.</description>

      <description>At Intercom, we believe that keeping our product online and working well at all times is critical to the success of our business. Out-of-hours on-call is inherently disruptive to your life as an engineer. You need to be ready to respond quickly and competently to an alert about something being broken. This means having a decent Internet connection, a computer, power for the computer, whatever you’re using for 2FA, and passwords available.</description>

      <description>Developers want speed. Customers want features. Security teams want time.
This presentation will discuss how Continuous Security can be moulded into the CI/CD pipeline. I&#39;ll outline how machine images and ec2 instances in our AWS environment are automatically tested by vulnerability assessment tools packaged in Docker containers. This assures a reasonably secure posture before features hit production and automates the ongoing process of penetration testing thereafter.
In addition to containers, our security automation toolchain comprises an open-sourced framework as well as a smidgeon of python running in AWS Lambda.</description>

The truth is that a successful adoption means a series of intertwined changes, all of which are required.</description>

      <description>I have given many talks about DevOps, but I realised, that I had always had the most focus on the Dev in DevOps. In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll try to the best of my ability to remedy that, and talk about the more Ops&amp;rsquo;y things we&amp;rsquo;ve had practical experiences with in a DevOps setting. For example: Have you considered that there might be inherent security risks looming if you implement a microservices architecture?</description>

      <description>The ultimate goal of any map if to start a conversation, form a strategy, and then successfully execute it. Wardley mapping is a two dimensional form of value chain mapping that plots visibility against the evolution of a given practice. This will be an introductory, hand-on workshop.
Most corporate strategies are based off of over-simplified models (if any) and depend largely on luck. Mapping helps visualize a strategy succinctly so what once took an hour and 25 slides to explain now takes 15 minutes and a map.</description>

      <description>There are many different leadership styles, but the best leaders demonstrate some common traits. The speaker will present the lessons, the good and her struggles, she learned about leadership in the Marine Corps and how these are applicable to tech leaders. Professional development and continued growth are the only surefire ways to ensure that you don’t get left behind in this crazy tech world. Applying military leadership lessons isn’t about crushing competition; but rather, it’s about leadership based on strategy, confidence in your vision, and integrity, all of which will put you above the competitor every time.</description>

      <description>For the last 40 years we&amp;rsquo;ve been using traditional operating systems to run our applications. Our operating systems are designed as generic underpinnings for our applications, but they come at the cost of lots of complexity.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be this way. If we&amp;rsquo;re willing to embrace immutable infrastructure we can compile the OS functionality into the application itself. Or, in the case of high level languages, into the language runtime.</description>

      <description>This talk is about how we transformed product development at WeTransfer from startup scale to an effective multi-team product organization. WeTransfer originated out of an advertising agency, and until 2017 it was mostly organized as one. This fitted the creative and fast-paced culture of the company, but as we grew it held us back in working towards our longer term goals and vision. We needed to become less reactive and regain control over product development.</description>

      <title>Web Application Firewall - Friend of your DevOps Chains</title>

      <guid>https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-zurich/program/franziska-buehler/</guid>
      <description>A Web Application Firewall may cause fear that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit into the DevOps methodology. But what if a WAF is involved very early in the DevOps process and not just at its end?
The problem is that when a WAF is added to production, the impact on the application is tested too late. Application developers get extremely late feedback and the WAF can probably break the application. I will show a way how to integrate a WAF and its testing into the deployment pipeline.</description>

DevOpsDays is a worldwide series of community run technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them. It is run by volunteers from community, for the benefit of the community. We are not a commercial conference and we believe that our focus on serving the community creates a truly unique experience for both delegates and sponsors.</description>

      <description>Infrastructures are growing rapidly and becoming more complex. Wouldn’t it be great to have an easy way to keep track of your nodes and what’s running on them? If you’re using Puppet Enterprise you have one already: it’s called PuppetDB. You can use PuppetDB with open source Puppet too.
PuppetDB automatically stores a lot of data about all of your Puppet managed nodes, including all of their facts and resources. At Puppet our Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team uses PuppetDB as the source of truth about our Puppet managed nodes.</description>

      <description>Containers and Kubernetes are a super hot topic in the tech industry right now, but as is often the case with hot new technologies, there&amp;rsquo;s lots of focus on the benefits and gains to be had (which there are lots!) with the tradeoffs often ignored. I&amp;rsquo;ll highlight a few of the issues that this migration path can cause both in the near-term and down the road so that you&amp;rsquo;re ready when you make the plunge!</description>

      <description>My dad once told me about a guy from Birmingham, a martial artist who’d learned tai-kwon-do, who could do jujitsu and would box.
Now, in his wisdom he devised his own style of martial arts, the principle was simple, if you couldn’t do it in a phone booth, it was no good to you in a pub fight.
With two paragraphs about Birmingham, kung-fu and pub fights you might be wondering how this could ever have anything to do with practical DevOps.</description>

      <description>A wise person once said &amp;ldquo;Automate as much as you can&amp;rdquo;. While this seems like an obvious statement at first blush, on further consideration there are a number of exceptions to this rule. This begs the question: What shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I automate? When automation seems like the obvious choice, it may be because we&amp;rsquo;re blind to the consequences or cost of that automation. This talk will give you a framework for deciding if you should automate a task.</description>

      <description>Driving old, beat-up cars is both a treat and a nightmare, especially when it comes to figuring out why they&amp;rsquo;ve stopped working (this time). In many ways, diagnosing issues with any old car feels not-at-all dissimilar to monitoring for and diagnosing failures in software. In this talk, I walk through some of the lessons my old junker has taught me about designing monitoring for software in the messy, icky, dammit-I-busted-knuckle-again real-world and how you can apply them to your own apps.</description>

      <description>Our systems are growing, not only in size but also in complexity. There are more and more relationships between systems, often via fragile network connections. We’re increasingly integrating with systems outside of our control. Not only that, but these systems are more dynamic. While we increase expectations of uptime, we’ve also continued to increase the communication entropy in the system. Many systems now change by the hour. And this only captures a portion of the complexity.</description>

      <description>This talk breaks down how the military practiced most of the things we value in technology organizations today. From visualizing work to failing fast (sometimes too fast) to diversity, this talk takes you on a journey through my time in the Air Force and pulls from lessons learned prior to my time in the service.
DevOps Points:
Kanban - Work could not pile up around anyone. Tickets could be used to track activity; used less to prioritize when to do work.</description>

      <description>The complexity of managing and delivering the high level of reliability expected of web-based, cloud hosted systems today, and the expectation of Continuous Delivery of new features has led to the evolution of a totally new field of Service Reliability Engineering catered for such systems. Google, who has been a pioneer in this field, calls it Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). While it would be more aptly named Service Reliability Engineering, the name has caught on.</description>

      <description>Growing up I wanted to follow my father&amp;rsquo;s footsteps and become private pilot and airline mechanic. While my career path deviated somewhat, I still find the parallels between aviation and software delivery to be uncanny. Both fields require strong discipline in communication, testing, and redundancy. Whether you are pushing to the cloud or just flying through it, the lessons learned in the aviation industry hold true and can improve your product and teams for the better.</description>

      <description>There is no question that the going is tough when it comes to open source projects. Building the excitement, community and hype is an undertaking unto itself - let’s not talk about monetization. Often times, just as your project is starting to get off the ground and generate real business - newer and cooler disruptors enter the playing field - and it gets hard to keep the momentum going. This talk is going to give some real world insight on what’s involved in really building a sustainable open source project, even when the hype is dwindling and the dust settles.</description>

      <description>When infrastructure automation concepts were first introduced, many IT professionals worried about automating themselves out of a job. But as we are dealing with our day to day challenges, Artificial Intelligence is making progress, achieving human parity in many areas of expertise. As AI is changing retail, healthcare, finance, manufacturing and even creative arts, is it time to ask when it is going to arrive in IT?
In this talk, I will overview the definitions of AI, ML and Deep Learning, the differences between AI and traditional programming and the relative difficulty of tasks that could be solved by AI.</description>

      <description>For many DevOps teams, their CI server has become just like the young shepherd-boy in the famous Aesop fable where he would cry wolf to falsely alarm the village to save their sheep. When the build is broken due to flaky automated tests, the team loses faith in the tests. How do we build the trust?</description>

      <description>When we started our project we had just a high level vision. As we dissected the idea into smaller pieces questions started to appear. Which framework to use? Database? Hosting? There are a lot of questions and the whole Internet with the best™ technologies to solve our problems. Any silver bullet?
The author tries to elaborate on why he thinks that incremental, small improvements shipped early &amp;amp; often are a better option - even if they might have flaws.</description>

      <description>TALK DESCRIPTION I want to share with you my experience with DevOps and how different organizations see DevOps differently. Finally, I will try to cover few challenging traits in Corporate culture that are hindering the adoption of true DevOps.
DevOps, Agile, and many more concepts fall under the umbrella of Digital Transformation and almost every enterprise is going through some type of Digital Transformation. However, according to the “2016 Digital Business Global Executive Study and Research Project” conducted by MIT Sloan Management Review and Deloitte Digital, corporate culture is one of several major barriers to Digital Transformation at large companies.</description>

      <description>Everything around you is made up of atoms, dna or code, there is a recipe on how everything is put together, and like most things &amp;hellip; as soon as things get created organically it gets messy, with advent of composable infrastructure or infrastructure as code, we need to focus more on getting reproducible systems as opposed to a patchwork of chaos. Using Test Driven techniques we can create and implement reliable, repeatable infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Who Broke Prod?  Growing a Culture of Blameless Failure</title>

      <description>In a world where we can deploy software and infrastructure changes within seconds, it’s reasonably easy to break stuff. When the inevitable bad stuff happens, humans tend to look for someone to blame. Research has shown that the most productive teams are those who don’t have to fear blame. On high-performing teams, people feel safe taking risks, making mistakes, and learning from them – so how do you build an environment where it’s OK to fail?</description>

      <description>It’s important to get alerts technically correct but too often we forget it’s a human that is receiving the alerts most of the time. We will go over critical questions you should ask and issues you should address to make sure the actual humans responding to your alerts can be effective and happy.
Too often we focus on getting the technicality of the alerts correct or rely on automated tools to receive them that we forget to make the alerts as friendly as possible for its main customer, the human responders.</description>

      <description>I work in the area of incident response and I’ve noticed that when issues occur, we all tend to point fingers. Blaming one another for incidents and outages perpetuates the “blame and shame” culture which not only has an affect on our teams, but the organization as a whole. Its a natural response to point fingers at others, it absolves us from blame and frees us from stressful situations. But there are serious consequences to perpetuating a blame and shame culture.</description>

      <description>Too often, Beta testing is bypassed for new services in a rush to develop and deliver on time. Beta user feedback is essential to providing a quality product and meeting customer needs. No beta customer = no closed loop = no feedback = bad product = unhappy customer = wasting more development time.</description>

      <description>We often tell the story of how we have succeeded to paint the art of the possible. No success comes without a prior failure. In this talk, I open the story of my devOps journey and share my failures in a way to encourage others to learn from adversity.
Perhaps I am alone here, but I have seen plenty of failures in my career. From the time we accidentally loaded the wrong version of Red Hat on a server because the burnt DVD said RHELv4 when it was RHELv5, or the time I put my foot in my mouth in front of a CTO of a major US financial services organization.</description>

      <description>There are many choices when looking for the right solution to manage and deploy our applications. We, as developers, are often overwhelmed with all of the options to choose from. One of our many options is Kubernetes. I’ve recently dived into deploying and managing an application on Kubernetes. In this talk, I will take you through my journey and explain the advantages and disadvantages of Kubernetes.
 What is Docker What is Kubernetes Dockering an application Using Kubernetes to deploy a containerized application on IBM Cloud Pros and cons of Kubernetes Common pitfalls  By the end of this talk, you will have the resources and tools to determine if this is the right solution for you and how you can get your application deployed!</description>

      <description>Fifteen minutes should be a small enough time for SCRUM team members to stay engaged in a meeting. Over the last 8 years of being a SCRUM team member, I have found this is not the case. Utilizing an improved format for the daily allows for better team member engagement and focus on completing work.</description>

      <description>Containerization is not only a software delivery paradigm shift; it also represents an opportunity to add sophisticated systems technology to any stack via sidecars. Instead of building complex client libraries for every language your organization deploys, common sidecars can take care of authorization/authentication, service discovery, and monitoring.
In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the patterns that have previously existed with practical examples of how they can be implemented in sidecars.</description>

      <description>The world is changing. You went away from waterfall and plan-driven development to doing agile. But why does agile not work? Why are you not faster and better and happier? You installed Scrum Masters, you have boards for Transparency, you have a Definition Of Done and you use Story Points. But did you really change your way of working? If a team believes they are agile, but nothing has changed about the way they test, they are probably not there yet.</description>

      <description>The increasing importance of our tooling, the rely on their ability to automate and potential damage when they don’t work properly should make us think about repositioning your tooling strategy. Nowadays tools are an essential part and getting more important every day for delivering high quality productivity, but why are we still handle them as non critical parts?
We can all agree that it’s seems such simple thing selecting your favourite tools, but that it’s actually a complex undertaking, by avoiding pitfalls and select your Swiss knife.</description>

      <description>When my wife, Mary, and I started telling people that we were leaving Silicon Valley to move to Minnesota, we were met with a variety of reactions. The most obvious was, “Oh, wow — it’s cold there, right?” Others asked, “What will you do for work?” Perhaps the oddest response was, “That seems really random!”
But living in the cradle of innovation was starting to feel oddly confined. Minnesota is different&amp;hellip; it has a growing tech community and benefits from a diverse state economy within which technology plays a key role in building its future.</description>

      <description>A few years back, most software systems had a monolithic architecture and slow release cycle. Lately, there has been a clear move towards microservices architecture, which is optimized for scalability, elasticity, and speed of change. But microservices architecture can become complicated. Because with microservices, we also need to figure out the service discovery, traffic management, load balancing, service identity and security, policy enforcement etc.. It&amp;rsquo;s easy if you have a simple application but as the number of services increases, this will become overwhelmingly complex.</description>

      <description>Public speaking is hard and this talk is about how I overcome that fear. I avoided public speaking for years. Whenever I speak, people compare me to Gordon Ramsay: I can&amp;rsquo;t not sound angry even though I&amp;rsquo;m not. But I had a recent breakthrough and I want to share this journey with you. There&amp;rsquo;s a lesson for everyone in this talk as we examine the role of women in tech, challenges of travel, tech conferences, the DevOps community, and more.</description>

      <description>Getting into a feedback loop with local startups is one of the most low cost and highest return ways a company can innovate. While focusing on exploiting their market through day to day opportunities, companies can also partner with early stage startups and explore how newer technologies can increase or better serve their customer base, and if successful, come up with plans to bring the technology in house. Startups are generally happy with this arrangement as they have the opportunity to test their products with potential clientele and get feedback from the best possible source: the customer.</description>

      <description>Many times during DevOps transformation, creating a technology architecture comes first. Then the uphill battle of closing skill and process gaps during adoption begins, which forces people to adjust to the technology. What if this process were reversed? This talk describes a real-world experience about how our Platform team created a distributed and non-optimized toolset architecture that allowed for teams with varying maturity to rapidly adopt and transform without that uphill battle.</description>

      <description>If you still spell Microsoft with a dollar ($) sign, think the technology platform responds to change as quickly as the Titanic, or still associate Microsoft with Visual Basic 6 (shudder), this ignite talk is for you. In this entertaining and rapid-fire session, we’ll show how Microsoft has embraced Agile, DevOps and open-source practices to innovate faster, engage the dev community, and work on making the “right” products. Then we’ll share how Principal is leveraging the Microsoft stack to advance our own DevOps journey.</description>

      <description>As technology becomes a bigger part of our lives, so does our power to affect people’s lives: not always for the better.
Technology can be a life saver, (i.e. the Maps app), but there has been an increase in cases where technology has done irrefutable damage to its users. Despite intending to connect people and serve as a positive resource, tech companies such as Facebook, Uber, Twitter, AirBnB, and others have also become vehicles for hate, assaults, murder and more.</description>

      <description>What can WordPress gain from Serverless Architecture?
WordPress is the most widely used CMS and a prime target for that reason. Going Serverless means there&amp;rsquo;s no Dashboard to hack and sites can now serve millions of hits per day with zero downtime or bottlenecks. This approach to hosting is more secure and scalable than any traditional web hosting product at a fraction of the cost.
I would like to demonstrate the benefits and how-to of taking WordPress Serverless.</description>

Trick question! I don&amp;rsquo;t think DBA&amp;rsquo;s are &amp;lsquo;by definition a silo&amp;rsquo;. I have been a DBA with outdated expectations of my roles in the past. And if you would like to know how to promote collaboration with your DBA team, I have some stories to share!</description>

      <description>Workshop This Hand-On session will show how a simple commit in git triggers automated bulding of the application, testing and deployment to different stages using a pipeline project in Jenkins. Each stage has its own pre-defined tests and successfully passing these autmatically starts the next stage. In case of errors custom notifications ensure that the neccessary tasks can be done to resolve the issues. In the background docker containers are created, started and destroyed once not in use anymore.</description>

After that I will step by step setup a kubernetes cluster with a HA master pair, HA dedicated etcd cluster, the use of rbac and network policies and authentication and authorization with tls certificates and openIDConnect. After the session, the participants should have a basic understanding about what kubernetes actually consists of and what you can do to safely and efficiently deploy a cluster without the need of a managed kubernetes service.</description>

      <description>Workshop If you had 90 days, what tools could you leverage to develop, train and deploy a machine learning model into production? In this talk I would like to share the story of how we developed JibJib, a machine learning powered app to classify birds by their calls, our entry for the Coding Davinci Ost 2018 Hackathon. Using tools like Docker, SaltStack and Terraform we have built a microservice architecture that supports a model hosted via TensorFlow serving, Google’s open-sourced solution for running machine learning in production.</description>

      <description>Workshop The bigger your infrastructure grows, the harder it becomes to maintain it via &amp;ldquo;ClickOps&amp;rdquo;. Once you have AWS, Heroku and Github and 10+ developers it starts feeling the fatigue of adding new people or managing access rules. Infrastructure as code is a solution. And one of the most convenient tools is Terraform, which you can get familiar with in this session. We will learn the ropes of Terraform and will take a sneak peek into deeper concepts, such as DRY with modules, using a remote state to obtain previously created pieces of infrastructure and some others.</description>

      <description>Workshop Pipelines are meant to be the road that will guide your team from code straight to production, automating everything on its way. Pipelines should be a source of joy for developers, the team’s safe harbour. But the reality can be different, and many teams are struggling to get their pipelines right, spending time and energy fighting against automation instead of having their pipelines delivering value.
We’ve observed that many companies and teams are struggling with their Continuous Delivery pipelines.</description>

      <description>Workshop Traditional CI\CD tools are meant to build artifacts which can then be deployed directly. However, this is not that easy in the context of building artifacts that are Docker images. This is because a running docker daemon is needed to build and push the image to a Docker registry. This can pose a serious security threat to the build host.
Hence, many tools (e.g. orca-build, buildah, &amp;hellip;) exist to build a docker image without the requirement of a running docker daemon.</description>

      <description>The divide between Engineering, Sales, Product, and Support has been noted, and dozens of attempts have been made to connect the groups. Technique aside, it comes down to communication. To get the partnership they need, tech teams must pave the way for other groups to communicate and collaborate.
If you’re a part of a technical team and frustrated by other groups (cough, Support, Product, or Sales, cough) constantly asking for updates, scope, reprioritization of features, more documentation, more training… the list goes on; then perhaps it’s time to take a step back and consider how to help those groups help themselves.</description>

      <description>People crave order. They especially crave order from services. They expect their fast-food orders to be correct and they expect the cable television installer to arrive within their scheduled window. They expect FEMA to help them when disaster strikes. They expect to be able to get 4G signal from anywhere on the planet. They expect their elected officials to keep the promises they made during their campaign (or worry that they might…), and to paraphrase Master Carlin, they expect people to drive like neither idiots nor maniacs.</description>

      <description>Creating a DevOps culture and implementing the technical bits like Continuous Delivery often require disruptive organizational change, and almost always require executive support.
How can you convince jaded people who have heard this all before? How do you help people who just want to “do their jobs” embrace the risk of change?</description>

      <description>In this experience report we will catch up with Columbia Sportswear (a Microsoft enterprise) 3 years into their journey to modernize enterprise IT. In year 3 DevOps is being scaled across the IT with many application teams changing how they are working.
 Year 1 - Getting started, Proofs of Concept, Making work visible, initial CHEF implementation Year 2 - Building a learning organization, ChatOps, Infrastructure as Code, Automating our own Data Centers Year 3 - Building a Business Case, Executive support, Convincing partners to come along on the journey, Mobile Dojo (original engineers are now coaching, mentoring, and helping new application teams to adopt DevOps), Public Cloud, Working with Microsoft Product teams at times to make products more DevOps friendly (VSTS : yaml build process, Dyanmics: DevOps)  In the last year Columbia has moved to Public Cloud first (Azure) and are implementing an open data platform using APIs and a microservices integration pattern to build an API Economy.</description>

      <description>As DevOps engineers we care deeply about keeping systems healthy to the point of engineering entire systems to run other systems. This is the case with Kubernetes, which has become the new hero for DevOps users. In this talk we talk about all the ways NOT to use Kubernetes - and the dangers therein.
Kubernetes has changed the DevOps industry more than any other open source tool. The new hero does not come without risk however.</description>

      <description>10 or 15 years ago we would hear “agile doesn’t work” from lots of people. They had “used agile” on a project, and the project failed anyway. Most of the time a little investigation revealed that they didn’t really try it at all. Instead they worked much like they always had, just for two weeks at a time instead of several months.
The same thing is happening with people “doing DevOps”.</description>

      <description>Are you really using that API to your advantage? Are you writing purpose specific code when the API provides you with the ability to create code that adapts and dynamically supports the operation you need? In this session I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how I created dynamically adapting code that utilizes Python&amp;rsquo;s reflection and introspection capabilities to do thousands of operations in my data center without changing or modifying a single line of the original code.</description>

      <description>Anxiety, stress and depression are becoming bigger parts of our lives as devs, whether we believe it or not. It’s time to confront the issues we’re facing rather than hiding from them. Carpenters fall off ladders, we burn out. We work our brains all day long, wtf do you think is going to happen!?
“I didn’t recognize you without your computer!” is what I used to hear a lot. I was in a constant battle with myself to keep coding, more and more.</description>

      <description>In 2015, DHI Group (with our primary product of the DIce.com technology recruiting site) made a decision to go &amp;ldquo;all in&amp;rdquo; on moving our business to the cloud (Amazon Web Services). In some ways, we viewed this as a continuation of the strategy we had been pursuing with some of our other brands and sites that we had either acquired already running on the AWS platform, or through some projects supporting international customers.</description>

      <description>Feelings are messy and uncomfortable, so why can’t you just ignore them? Because it doesn’t work; you’ll write substandard code and be a suboptimal teammate.
In this talk you’ll learn how emotions are affecting your work and what you can do about it. I use the metaphor of an API as a way to talk about how your emotional system functions. I’ll go over some of the code in my own emotional API, and how I have refactored it using a toolbox full of techniques.</description>

      <description>As makers, we have a magic power to create something from nothing. But I have to warn you, magic can be used for good or evil. Technology can not only disrupt, it can destroy. From self-driving cars to nanobots, people are worried about their health and economic well-being.
With emerging technology, it is important to choose to build for humane experiences. Kevin Web Page champions for innovation by studying the potential impact not just on businesses, but the world.</description>

But what do you do when you’re forced to work with someone who just doesn’t get it, and how do you get to a place where work can happen seamlessly? This talk uses empirical research and practical tips around how to learn more about yourself, understand the perspective of others, and bring empathy into your daily work.</description>

      <description>4am on-call alerts that wake you only to restart an unresponsive web server. Developers, who can&amp;rsquo;t decide if five machines is enough to run their new application. Sudden traffic spikes that force you to spin extra service instances on Friday evening. Misplaced deployments. Frequent requests for yet another 50gb of network storage.
Does it sound too familiar? Are you wondering whether some cluster management system could take care of all of this boring stuff and let you focus on really cool problems?</description>

Last year, I was triggered by Martijn van Asseldonks blog on psychological safety. Together we developed a workshop format that can help team members to open up on this. I facilitated the SAFE-O-METER several times and was really impressed on how open people can speak about not feeling safe.</description>

      <description>Меня зовут Исанин Антон, в Альфа-Банке я занимаю позицию руководителя центра качества. В силу особенностей штатной структуры Альфа-Банка Центр качества не относится ни к Dev части , ни к OPS части ИТ, а как бы &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;болтается&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; между этими двумя очень крупными департаментами. Такая штатная структура позволила в своё время наладить хорошие горизонтальные связи от dev к ops в рамках продуктовых направлений и вообще способствовала развитию &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;горизонтального взгляда&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; на организацию. Что в свою очередь мне как руководителю центра качества позволило разработать и утвердить стратегию DevOps трансформации компании.</description>

      <description>Baruch’s passion is speaking about technology. Well, speaking in general, but doing it about technology makes him look smart, and 17 years of hi-tech experience sure helps. When he’s not on stage (or on a plane to get there), he learns about technology, people and how they work, or more precisely, don’t work together.
Baruch is a Head of DevRel and a Developer Advocate at JFrog, a CNCF Ambassador, a passionate conference speaker on DevOps, Java and Groovy topics, and is a regular at the industry’s most prestigious events including JavaOne (where he was awarded a Rock Star award), DockerCon, Devoxx, DevOps Days, OSCON, Qcon and many others.</description>

      <description>I am a researcher at the National Research Council Canada (CNRC-NRC), where I study the convergence of virtual reality with health technologies. I have spent my entire career split between the worlds of medical devices and gaming, and I&amp;rsquo;ve worn multiple hats including that of researcher, developer, SDET and test lead. My superpower is taking good ideas that sort of work, and making them work in real life - hopefully not killing anyone in the process.</description>

      <description>I am a software developer who stumbled upon testing out of necessity and never managed to truly leave. I am spent most of my career writing code for medical devices - a high-stakes industry where effective testing is critical (and often involves actual human bodies). I also worked at Unity as an SDET (aka “a software developer who tests”) in the Animation and Storytelling teams.
I am currently a researcher at the National Research Council Canada (NRC) where I study the convergence of virtual reality, gaming technology and medical devices, and where I help Canadian medical device companies bring innovative technologies to market.</description>

      <description>Charts are a very useful and easy way to present information.
The problem is that when done wrong, they can do more damage than good. They can be completely useless or even worse - lie and deceive.
Picking the right type of chart for your data is just half way to success. On top of that you&amp;rsquo;d have to know your way around the data.
So, do you have what it takes to create the perfect chart?</description>

      <description>Quer saber mais sobre SRE? Pergunte me como :-)
Eu sou um Site Reliability Engineer no Google da Irlanda, onde já atuei nas áreas de Ads e Cloud. Hoje eu também faço parte da equipe que treina novos SREs entrando na empresa, além de também dar consultoria a equipes de desenvolvimento. A cultura SRE sempre me fascinou e falar sobre isso, tanto dentro da Google quanto fora, sempre me deixa muito animado!</description>

      <description>With over 30 years of hands-on experience, Daniel has watched the technology industry go through several evolutions and revolutions. As an early cloud adopter and evangelist, he fondly remembers the days when the only publicly available cloud service was SQS and the only interface to any cloud service was via API or CLI.
As a founding partner and CTO of CloudOps, Daniel embraced the transition from pets to cattle and helped our clients do the same.</description>

      <description>David has spent the last two years working for Red Hat on Openstack deployments for private cloud solutions, and have run into some amazing problems and integration issues with different software used to manage different resources. You never know what is going to trip you up. Talking to storage solutions, integrating a directory solution, integrating with a network vendor, meeting security auditing and compliance requirements. So often those parts of a project are not fully scoped and don’t have the time or resources to resolve the interaction of those items.</description>

      <description>From fledgling startups to established industry, the Midwest is home to a large, vibrant technology community. Chicago, in particular, has been a flurry of activity in the past several years, drawing attention from around the globe. DevOpsDays Chicago brings development, operations, QA, InfoSec, management, and leadership together to discuss the culture and tools to make better organizations and products. The 2018 event will be the fifth time we have held DevOpsDays Chicago, and it should be bigger and better than ever before!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m doing the technical operations of SAPs cloud based ride sharing solution &amp;lsquo;TwoGo by SAP&amp;rsquo;. TwoGo became the first product in SAP history which delivers changes on a daily basis to our customers (since Oct. 2014). We archived this as a pilot in our company applying Continuous Delivery and DevOps techniques and now act as a role model and knowledge multiplicator within SAP. I give external talks and presentations (e.g. DevOpsDays Paris 2015, Entwicklertag Karlsruhe, Beyond Borders MeetUp -DevOps Amsterdam, Continuous Lifecycle 2015, Delivery of Things World 2016) on Continuous Delivery and DevOps (with focus on large enterprises), as well as SAP internal workshops on these subjects.</description>

Professionally I do performance analysis, assessments, data analysis, architecture design, and other random work as the need arises. I’m a bad coder but I do that too, occasionally, by necessity.
I’m not a big fan of social networks. I was never big on them, but I’ve not frightened myself into ever getting too into them. I dont say much online or in person that I dont presume wont pop up as a recording or screenshot later =)</description>

      <description>Emily Freeman grew up in the “swamp” as Trump lovingly refers to it. With politics in her blood, she chased after her dream of living out an episode of the West Wing. After four years of arguing — pretty much sums up a PoliSci degree — she left school disappointed that campaigns are more about recruiting 20-year-olds to live in poverty than it is to wine and dine Koch brothers.</description>

Currently, I work as a DevOps Evangelist at JobScore, where I’m architecting AWS infrastructures, taking care of infrastructure operations, developing pieces of automation, and helping build and spread the DevOps culture within the company.</description>

      <description>Sou a Flavia, agilista antes mesmo de conhecer o Manifesto. Vivo isso tudo fora do ambiente corporativo em meu dia-a-dia e sempre encontrei certa rejeição a quem levasse algo diferente para lá. Mas, de certa forma mostrava o que podia através de pequenas ações dentro do que era aceitável por eles.
Trabalhei muitos anos (todos, aliás) no modelo tradicional e essa inquietação com o que presenciava e o que acreditava ser uma visão mais aberta sobre as coisas fez com que meu entendimento sobre a agilidade fosse quase que instantâneo.</description>

      <description>Over the past decade of participating in the production of dozens of apps and growing several engineering teams, I’ve learned a tremendous amount about how not to run a company in a sustainable manner, as well as a few things that work. My experience is very much cross-disciplinary - spanning UX design, front-end development, product management, and operations. I’m currently a Partner at Very and am on a quest to discover how to measure, understand, and help both my company - and those we interact with - establish a generative, sustainable culture.</description>

      <description>As one of the first Chief Data Officers in federal government, Greg Elin routinely encountered the manually-intensive nature of the FISMA compliance and NIST Risk Management Framework as the primary constraint on data innovation during his tenure at the Federal Communications Commission.

Mr. Elin is now CEO of GovReady PBC which The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate recently awarded a two-year contract to build an open source expert system for FISMA.</description>

      <description>Holly is a leadership coach for women in male-dominated industries. She works one-on-one with ambitious women to help them lead, get promoted, and create the careers they actually want in industries they love.
As a mining engineer for the first ten years of her career, Holly was exposed to one of the most male-dominated spaces &amp;ndash; just 17% female. She uses the unique perspective she gained as a woman in mining, alongside her obsessive nerdiness for all things feminism, leadership, and career to help women create the working world they deserve while they wait for the rest of society to catch up.</description>

      <description>I’ve always been fascinated by the confusion between engineers, and non- engineers. Even though they can work at the same company, it seems like they are speaking completely different languages sometimes. I’ve found with enough patience and proper abstraction, I can explain just about any deep technical concept to someone who does not work with computers for a living. As a hobby I love organising things and making abstract concepts tangible.</description>

Sou de uma família onde as mulheres assumiram muitos papéis, desde encanadoras à churrasqueiras, pois a presença masculina não era evidente em nossa casa. Com isso aprendi muito sobre meu papel na sociedade e o que posso fazer pra ajudar outras mulheres.
Sou apoiadora de alguns grupos de incentivo à mulheres na tecnologia, como o FemmeIT, QALadies e Test Girls.</description>

      <description>Manah has over 20 years of software engineering in various roles including architecture, design, testing, and security. That helped me look at application security and its impact, seen from the various stakeholders of application systems: IT, Management, Legal, Business Partners, Security and others. The cost of Security on IT is significant, taking away expensive capacity from the business. In my experience the solution was to prioritize the spending on security related initiative equally between tools and technical debt, and ways to change and measure the organizational culture.</description>

When he’s not fighting imperial regimes he falls into his role as a mild-mannered husband raising three titans-of-industry. A busy and productive life often requires the counter balance of slothful recreations. For fun Marc pwn noobz, farm resources, and plays-the-objective, which results in a higher state of “gamerscore.”</description>

      <description>Human animal, male, slightly overweight. First non-fiction book I ever read was Teach yourself C programming in 24 days. This was before I had access to any computer smarter than my casio wristwatch. Some rich people taught me how money works and now I’m helping communities thrive at Zoona, a payment systems provider in Zambia and Malawi. We aspire to create a digital finance platform that will touch the lives of a Billion people in the next few years.</description>

      <description>Veteran cab driver, Rookie Tech. After a 15 year career in cab driving, I decided I wanted to go to college and make something of myself. I’m graduating with an Associate’s degree in Network Security in May this year and have two years of general help desk and networking experience under my belt. Adjusting to a 9-5 has been fabulous, editing my sailor’s mouth has been difficult. I gravitate to DevOps for the touchy-feely parts as I transition my career and work culture, but appreciate and absorb the technical parts to see how everything fits together.</description>

      <description>I am a software engineer, and system operations enthusiast.

      <description>I am a 20-year security professional, and worked with many organizations (companies and public) to secure application deployments. My interests are organizational. I believe that security can improve using better practices and communications, with tools and software as implementations of good security habits. Unlike many of my colleagues, I saw containers as a security opportunity, and joined Aqua to prove it. Over the past two years, I have been talking and presenting to hundreds of developers, operations and security people, with the goal to build a bridge and establish collaboration.</description>

I grew up in Johannes Gutenberg&amp;rsquo;s neighborhood — you could say it was the Silicon Valley of the 15th century. Now, I usually don&amp;rsquo;t have a beard, but the things I enjoy doing are at that same intersection of technology, content, design &amp;amp; repeatability.
As a technology evangelist, I&amp;rsquo;m working with modern, distributed systems. This usually includes a huge variety of concepts, platforms, and tools.</description>

      <description>Ter um ambiente DevOps significa zelar por diversos aspectos de qualidade do software, incluindo segurança. Para isso, o termo DevSecOps foi criado para mostrar a importância da segurança existir como parte do processo, não algo postiço, que pode atrapalhar o desenvolvimento e entregas de valor.
Os novos tipos de automação como Infraestrutura como Código, Integração Contínua, Entrega e Implantação Contínuas, micro serviços, containers e plataformas de serviço na nuvem acabam ajudando a criar sistemas seguros por padrão e por design.</description>

      <description>Cette conférence portera sur l’utilisation du patron « strangler » que nous avons utilisé pour décommissionner et réacheminer progressivement le trafic loin de notre monolithe. Nous présenterons également les solutions Kubernetes « cloud-native » que nous avons adoptées.
Concilier une architecture de microservices avec une application monolithique n’est pas chose facile. Avec un peu de chance, il existe un chemin de migration : utiliser le patron de « strangler » pour décommissionner et réacheminer progressivement le trafic sans affecter les clients des API.</description>

      <description>Мы обсудим как меняется и будет меняться доставка ПО мире децентрализованных организаций и информационных систем.
Традиционные ИТ-организации (они-же динозавры) вымирают. Им на смену приходят новые типы компаний. Без офисов, с минимальной иерархией, состоящие из автономных команд. Эти изменения происходят параллельно с концептуальным сдвигом в разработке и использовании информационных систем. Блокчейн, интернет вещей, периферийные вычисления - все двигает нас в сторону все большей децентрализации и новых инструментов общественного договора.
В процессе доклада мы рассмотрим:</description>

      <description>В своём докладе я хотел бы рассказать с чего у нас начиналась devops трансформация , как процессы выглядели тогда и как выглядят сейчас, что devops уже дал компании, прижилась ли devops -культура и какие с этим были и есть проблемы и что мы собираемся делать дальше&amp;rdquo;.
Тезисы доклада :
 почему мы пошли в DevOps с чего мы начинали и почему нас все за это ругали почему получилось зажечь массы темой devops как тема с DevOps проникла на С-level и что из этого вышло как мы &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;синхронизировали&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; понимание DevOps среди топ менеджеров как мы пытались пытались развивать DevOps культуру и что из этого вышло что трансформация дала сейчас и как мы видим свою дальнейшую трансформацию где мы реально набили шишки и где получается не так красиво как в теории  </description>

      <description>Одна из основополагающих концепций DevOps – быстрая поставка изменений. По сути, разработчики могут сделать так, что новая фича будет доступна пользователям в считанные минуты после коммита, но как гарантировать, что качество продукта при этом не пострадает?
Здесь на сцену выходят специалисты QA, которым тоже придется много чего переделать с приходом в команду методологии DevOps. Ведь если после супер-быстрой сборки и установки новой версии на тестовый стенд, последуют обычные ручные функциональные и регрессионные тесты, то это сведет на нет пользу от всех внедренных практик CI/CD.</description>

      <description>Ряд практических советов и решений, которые будут полезны каждому, кто работает с проектами, которые должны быть постоянно доступны, другими словами – любому коммерческому проекту.
Текущее развитие облачных технологий позволяет иметь полностью автономную отказоустойчивую инфраструктуру, при этом без дополнительных финансовых затрат. В докладе речь идет о ключевых шагах, которые полезно знать как системным администраторам/operations, так и разработчикам.
Несмотря на то, что инфраструктура облачных провайдеров является самовосстанавливающейся и отказоустойчивой, необходимо понимать, как эта отказоустойчивость работает и как с этим нужно правильно работать.</description>

      <description>В последние несколько лет безопасность разрабатываемого кода становится все важнее. Со страниц прессы не сходят сообщения об очередном взломе, утечке, воровстве данных или прерывании сервиса из за того что злоумышленники нашли уязвимости в том или ином широко распространённом программном обеспечении. Гранды ИТ вроде Cisco, EMC, Microsoft, Red Hat уже много лет применяют методы Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC) для снижения количества уязвимостей и дефектов в коде. Мы небольшая команда из 40 разработчиков которая создает бизнес приложения для энтерпрайз заказчиков заботящихся о безопасности.</description>

      <description>Вместе с участниками мастер-класса мы развернём в OpenShift Origin необходимую инфраструктуру и поработаем с реальным IT-решением, созданным с использованием Akka Framework. Для него мы с нуля настроим конвейер непрерывной доставки ПО, визулизированный мониторинг и средства обеспечения контроля качества, доступные &amp;ldquo;as a service&amp;rdquo;.
В ходе мастер-класса мы:
 создадим CI/CD pipeline с контролем качества каждого из этапов, в рамках которого мы выгрузим исходный код из репозитория, проверим его качество, соберём приложение, созданное с использованием Akka Framework, создадим на его основе образы Docker, развернём приложение на среде исполнения OpenShift Origin, а также проведём его функциональное и нагрузочное тестирование.</description>

      <description>Учи.ру - онлайн-платформа для школьного образования, более 2 миллионов школьников, регулярно решают у нас интерактивные занятия. Все наши проекты хостятся полностью в публичных облаках, 100% приложений работают в контейнерах, начиная от самых маленьких, для внутреннего пользования, и заканчивая крупными продакшенами на 1k+ запросов в секунду. Так получилось, что у нас 15 изолированных докер-кластеров (не Kubernetes, sic!) в пяти облачных провайдерах. Полторы сотни пользовательских приложений, количество которых постоянно растет.
Я буду рассказывать очень конкретные вещи: как мы переходили на контейнеры, как управляемся с инфраструктурой, проблемы с которыми столкнулись, что заработало, а что нет.</description>

      <description>Сервисная архитектура сейчас популярна: модная, удобная для разработки и менеджмента, результат быстрый и наглядный. Повышает привлекательность компании на рынки труда, позволяет сотрудникам развиваться и наполнять резюме чем-то интересным. Поначалу легко и непринужденно развертывается, поддерживается и развивается. В какой-то печальный момент всё разваливается и не всегда собирается обратно быстро и без потерь. Рецепт, как не оказаться у разбитого корыта, в общем-то, простой. Тут как с авто: вовремя делать ТО и вовремя избавиться.</description>

      <description>Компоненты с открытым исходным кодом активно используются при разработке. Однако, чтобы выпуск релиза был своевременным, программный продукт был качественным и стабильным, open source компоненты необходимо тщательно подбирать. Процесс управления компонентами на всех этапах жизненного цикла ПО принципиально отличается от сканирования программного кода и имеет ряд особенностей. Выделенное место занимает задача управления лицензионными рисками при использовании открытого исходного кода. Поговорим об инструментах автоматизации управления open source на всех стадиях проекта - от подбора компонентов до отслеживания новых дефектов после выпуска релиза.</description>

      <description>Хочу поделится опытом внедрения технологий и практик DevOps в рабочие процессы компании. Историей того как внедряются технологии DevOps в большой корпорации в мире Windows и какие уже есть результаты.
В докладе описаны технологии, которые мы используем в процессе разработки решений и их поставке. Большая часть кода решений написана на C# для платформы MS SharePoint, а соответственно для разработки автотестов используются MSTest и NUnit. В качестве вспомогательных инструментов используется MS Fakes/Moles и библиотека SharePoint Emulators.</description>

      <description>Мы занимаемся заказной разработкой ПО и запускаем более 15 проектов в год, в основном это крупные серверные системы на микросервисной архитектуре. Инфраструктура любого проекта на 80% идентичная и нам каждый раз приходилось настраивать одни и те же системы по нескольку раз для каждого проекта. Это приводило к излишним трудозатратам и ошибкам.
Для решения этой проблемы мы внедрили и используем такой подход DevOps как «инфраструктура как код». Теперь вся инфраструктура - это код.</description>

      <description>“Na minha máquina funciona!” - desenvolvedor que não utiliza docker.
Hoje em dia é muito difícil mantermos ambientes integrados com as mesmas tecnologias. Orquestrar vários serviços, administrar dependências, avaliar atualização de pacotes. Estes são problemas inerentes a equipes que mantêm mais de um servidor com código funcionando (ou seja, qualquer equipe que no mínimo tenha um ambiente de desenvolvimento e um ambiente de produção).
Com o docker esse processo passa a ser muito mais simples de ser realizado e muito mais contido.</description>
